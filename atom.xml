    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is – insofar as it is thinkable at all – primitive and muddled.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Albert Einstein </p></blockquote><p>Epistemology is a branch of philosophy which studies knowledge. It concerns problems such as: how is knowledge defined (what does it mean to know something)? What is the value of knowledge? What is the structure of knowledge? I became interested in epistemology recently and have started reading Duncan Pritchard’s introductory text <em>What is This Thing Called Knowledge?</em> I can’t help but want to write down some of the things I’ve learned from my reading. In this post, I will talk about some key ideas from  Pritchard’s book.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="The-Problem-of-Criterion"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Criterion" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Criterion"></a>The Problem of Criterion</h4><p>When we think about what we know, we usually think about one of two kinds of knowledge: 1. <em>propositional knowledge</em>, knowledge expressible with a proposition, such as “the sky is blue”, or 2. <em>ability knowledge</em>, such as the knowledge of how to swim. Henceforth, when talking about knowledge, we will always be referring to the former. It is agreed upon epistemologists that the two basic elements for one to posess a piece of knowledge are truth and belief: one should believe the knowledge and the knowledge itself should be true. However, these two conditions not sufficient. Knowledge is not merely true beliefs: one can have true beliefs completely by accident. Suppose that there is a doctor who diagnoses a patient by a toss of a coin. Suppose also that the coin toss happens to give the correct diagnoses, then does it follow that the doctor knows what is wrong with the patient? Obviously not. Thus, it is a problem for epistemologists to try and figure out what is needed to be added to give a satisfactory definition (i.e. criterion) of knowledge. However, anyone who wishes to define knowledge faces the an immediate problem. To know the criterion of knowledge we need to know all that we do know, but to know all that we do know requires us to know the criterion of knowledge itself. It’s a <em>Catch-22</em>. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_the_criterion"><em>problem of the criterion</em></a>. </p><ol><li>What do we know (what is the extent of our knowledge)?</li><li>How do we know (what is the criterion of knowledge)?</li></ol><p>Each of these two problems are impossible to answer without first answering the other. One approach seeks to answer the first question first – this is stance called <em>particularism</em>, advocated by Roderick Chisholm “we start with particular cases of knowledge and then from those we generalise and formulate criteria [which tell] us what it is for a belief to be epistemologically respectable.” The antithesis of this position is <em>methodism</em>, exemplified by René Descartes, which seeks to answer the second question first. This position states that it is possible, through philosophical reflection alone, to identify criterions of knowledge, and through which to identify instances of knowledge. This is the position taken by classical empiracists. There is also a third stance, skepticism, which proclaims that since it is impossible to answer one question without the other, we are unable to answer either question, and hence unable to justify any of our beliefs. </p><h4 id="Gettier-Cases"><a href="#Gettier-Cases" class="headerlink" title="Gettier Cases"></a>Gettier Cases</h4><p>A very natural methodist attempt to the problem of criterion, typically attributed to Plato, is to proclaim that knowledge are <em>justified</em> true beliefs, i.e. true beliefs with some good basis or grounds. This is the <em>tripartite theory of knowledge</em>. However, things are not that simple. The philosopher Edmund Gettier, in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949">a three-page article</a>, gave a list of devastating counter-examples to the tripartite theory, which we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem"><em>Gettier Cases</em></a>, showing that it is completely untenable. In essence, it shows that you could have a justified true belief but still lack knowledge because your true belief was gained by luck in the same way as the previous example of the doctor. </p><p>I will here paraphrase an example of such a case from Pritchard’s book. Imagine a man named, say, John, comes downstairs one morning and sees the clock on the living room says it’s 8 o’clock. On this basis, John believes it is 8 o’clock. John usually comes downstairs around this time, and the clock has been very realiable in the past, so John is justified in his belief. Suppose, however, it was unbeknownst to him that the clock had stopped precisely 12 hours ago. So John had a justified true belief which does not intuitively constitute knowledge – other Gettier cases more or less have the same structure as this example. Therefore, the tripartite account is insufficient for the criterion of knowledge (it is, however, agreed among epistemologists that the tripartite conditions are necessary for having knowledge). </p><p>It was at first believed that the Gettier cases could be amended by tweaking the tripartite condition, such as stipulating that the belief should be true, justified, and not based on false presuppositions. However, it is difficult to specify the meaning of “presuppositions”, e.g. you could have a justification of a true belief with a false presupposition. For example, John could have a friend Sally who looks at a working clock and thinks that the time is 8 o’clock, but she might justify this by presupposing the clock is regularly maintained, which happens to not be the case. Moreover, it is also not clear that a presuppoosition is needed at all. For example, suppose a farmer forms a belief that there is a sheep in the field by looking at a shaggy dog which looks like a sheep, but there actually is a sheep on the field, standing behind the dog. Thus, it is difficult to respond to Gettier cases. </p><h4 id="Agrippa’s-trilemma"><a href="#Agrippa’s-trilemma" class="headerlink" title="Agrippa’s trilemma"></a>Agrippa’s trilemma</h4><p>The nature of justification is enigmatic. Pick any belief for which you have a justification, then it still remains the question: what justifies the justification itself? And if we have a justification of that justification, what justifies it then? We could keep asking this question ad infinitum. Thus, we find ourselves in the following predicament called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma#Agrippa's_Trilemma">Agrippa’s trilemma</a> (or Münchhausen trilemma): in order to justify any statement, we must accept one of the following kind of arguments, each of which is unsatisfactory: </p><ol><li><em>circular argument</em>: the justification of a proposition presupposes itself,</li><li><em>regressive argument</em>: each justification requires a further justification ad infinitum,</li><li><em>dogmatic argument</em>: some statements are regarded as accepted precepts (merely asserted but not defended).</li></ol><p>Some philosophers embrace option 1, and proclaim that a circular chain of arguments can justify a claim, which is a position called <em>coherentism</em>. This is usually supplemented with the proviso that the circular chain must be large enough. Other philosophers embrace option 2, and proclaim that we can justify a claim by an infinite chain of arguments, which is a position called <em>infinitism</em>. The third position is to embrace option 3, and proclaim some beliefs are justified without without any further justification, which is a position known as <em>foundationalism</em> – the position taken in modern mathematics. The dominant foundationalist view states that some beliefs do not require further justification because there are self-justifying – this is known as <em>classical foundationalism</em>. An example of a classical foundationalist is Descartes. He argued that the foundations for our knowledge are those that immune to doubt and are hence self-evident. He gave the example of ones belief of ones own existance. I cannot doubt my own existance because for me to doubt – to think – requires my existing in the first place. Hence his famous line, “I think, therefore I am.”</p><h4 id="The-Problem-of-Perception"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Perception" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Perception"></a>The Problem of Perception</h4><p>A large portion of our knowledge comes from our senses, i.e. perceptual knowledge. We tend to think that our sensory faculties are reliable, but perceptual knowledge can deceive us. This is because fundamentally perceptions are an <em>indirect</em> way of gaining knowledge – our perceived reality could be hallucinations undetectable from reality. This is the <em>argument from illusion</em>. It is odd as it contradicts our intuitive sense that we are directly experiencing reality, hence we have a problem: could we ever directly directly perceive the physical world? This is the <em>problem of perception</em>.</p><p>One response to this problem is <em>indirect realism</em>, which embraces the apparent indirectness of our perception, and proclaims that we gain knowledge of the objective world by making inferences from our sense impressions. John Locke makes the distinction between primary and secondary qualities of an object perceived: a primary quality of an object is a quality independent of anyone perceiving the object e.g. shape, and a secondary quality is a quality dependent upon the perception of an object, e.g. color. Indirect realists use this notion to distinguish world-as-it-is and world-as-perceived. This view, however, threatens to dislocate ourselves from the world. Skeptics respond by the famous thought experiment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat"><em>brain in a vat</em></a>: how do we know whether our perceived reality is simulated with a supercomputer? This is the <em>problem of the external world</em>. How could I, in this case, infer anything at all about the objective world? Thus, there is no reason to assume so in the first place.</p><p>The view that denies there is a world independent of our experience is <em>idealism</em>, a famous exponent of which is George Berkeley. This position claims that perceptual knowledge is not knowledge of a world independent of perception, but knowledge of a world constituted by our perception of it. In this view, the world is constructed out of perception – “to be is to be perceived.” However, idealist typically don’t agree that the world cease to exist when no one is to perceive it. To avoid such dramatic consequence, Berkeley proclaims that there is a God who perceives everything, which does not convince me very much. Another version of idealism is <em>transcendental idealism</em> by Immanuel Kant. Kant argues that although what we perceive may not be the world itself, we are required to suppose that there is an external world which gives rise to such experience, without which we cannot make sense of it. This sounds like indirect realism, but it is idealism in the sense that Kant rejects the possibility of gaining knowledge independent of experience through experience at all, directly or not</p><h4 id="A-Priori-A-Posteriori-and-Problem-of-Induction"><a href="#A-Priori-A-Posteriori-and-Problem-of-Induction" class="headerlink" title="A Priori, A Posteriori, and Problem of Induction"></a>A Priori, A Posteriori, and Problem of Induction</h4><p>We distinguish between a priori knowledge, knowledge gained independent of empircal investigation, and a posteriori knowledge i.e. empircal knowledge. For example, an important variety of a priori knowledge is introspection – the examination of one’s own psychology. All proposition that one could have a priori knowledge of, one could also have a posteriori knowledge of. From these knowledge, we could infer more with argument. The general types of arguments are: deduction, induction, abduction, analogy and fallacy. Inductive arguments infer from a large number of a posteriori knowledge, the sample, a general claim that goes beyond the sample. David Hume raised the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction"><em>problem of induction</em></a> which questions whether inductive arguments are justified. There seem that the only way to justify inductive arguments is by further use of the argument – by observing the correlation between observed regularity in a large sample and unrestricted regularity. The justification of the inductive inference is circular. Some respond to the problem by claiming it is a fundamental epistemic practice, and some claim that it does not matter as long as inductive arguments work, but those defenses are hardly intellectually satisfying. </p><p>Karl Popper’s response to this problem is <em>critical rationalism</em>: inductive inference are never used in science, instead they conjecture hypotheses, deductively infer consequences from them, and empiracally try to falsify the consequences. Therefore, scientists in fact use deductive inferences rather than inductive inferences. There are some problems with this position. One problem is in this view, we do not actually know the generalizations that scientists make, but only the falsity of the falsified theories. This would mean we don’t know that the “correct” scientific theories are true, only that they have not been falsified yet. Another problem is that it is not clear how much counter evidence is needed to falsify a claim. If it is been observed for many years that emus are flightless, then a testimony that one has seen a flying emus does not necessarily constitude enough evidence to falsify that claim. An alternative approach is given by Hans Reichenbach’s <em>pragmatism</em>. Reichenbach agrees that there is no justification for inductive reference, but it is pragmatic to use it since it gives us a lot of true beliefs of the world, thus it is nevertheless a rational thing to do. </p><h4 id="Problem-of-Other-Minds"><a href="#Problem-of-Other-Minds" class="headerlink" title="Problem of Other Minds"></a>Problem of Other Minds</h4><p>We take for granted that other people have minds like we do, but this is not entirely obvious. We cannot observe other minds like we observe objects, and we cannot experience other’s perspective like we experience our own either. Thus, there is skepticism to whether other people also have the first person experience like <em>I</em> do. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_other_minds"><em>problem of other minds</em></a></p><p>The most famous response is from John Stuart Mill, who make use of inductive reasoning. I observe that the behaviors of others mirror our own, from this I inductively infer that they have minds like I do. This is the <em>argument from analogy</em>. There are problems with this argument as well. In the 1956 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049366/"><em>Invasion of the Body-Snatchers</em></a>, aliens quitely replace real people but they act and behave just like regular people, but they do not experience the world as we do. This points out the flaw in the argument from analogy: we cannot be sure just by observing behavior. In this argument, we could infer that things, such as a highly advanced robot, has a mind, when it is not clear if it is true. A series of videos on this topic (in Chinese) can be found <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1D94y1m7Ft/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=54d0c49d785d283eeaaec59f84aebba4">here</a>.</p><h4 id="Radical-Skeptical-Paradox"><a href="#Radical-Skeptical-Paradox" class="headerlink" title="Radical Skeptical Paradox"></a>Radical Skeptical Paradox</h4><p>A skeptical hypothesis is a scenario whereby one is severely deceived about the world but unable to detect such deception. In epistemology, skeptical hypotheses are used as a litmus test for any theory of knowledge. Thus skepticism is seen as a methodological devil’s advocate. This gives rise to the <em>radical skeptical paradox</em>: since we are unable to know the denials of skeptical hypotheses, we are unable to know anything of substance at all about the world. There is a lot more about this topic, but I’m tired and I think I will stop here. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

    <title>A Go Variant: Terrain Go</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“The rules of go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play go. “</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Edward Lasker </p></blockquote><p>The game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> is an ancient and profound abstract strategy board game that I, albeit losing most of my games, enjoy playing very much. If you have not heard of Go before, see <a href="https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go">here</a> for a quick guide to the rules of Go. I’ve been recently designing my own variant of Go, which I call “Terrain Go” tentatively for lack of a better name. This variant is inspired by Bobby Fischer’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess">Fischer random chess</a>, which is a chess variant that, at the outset of the game, randomizes the initial positions of pieces at the players’ home ranks in a certain way that preserves the dynamic nature of the game. The variant is designed to “eliminate the complete dominance of openings preparation in classical chess, replacing it with creativity and talent.” In a similar spirit, we introduce randomness at the outset of Go by way of “terrain”, in a way that preserves the dynamic nature of Go.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Rules"><a href="#Rules" class="headerlink" title="Rules"></a>Rules</h4><p>At the beginning of the game, each intersection on the 19 by 19 board will be assigned one of the following types</p><ul><li>Mountain, indicated by a triangle \(\Delta\)</li><li>Water, indicated by a square \(\square\)</li><li>Plains, with no indication</li></ul><p>and they are generated randomly in a way such that each group of \(\Delta\) or \(\square\) does not surround empty intersections, and that there are exactly 60 in 2 to 4 groups of each \(\Delta\) or \(\square\), each group having at least 12 stones. Therefore, 60 intersections are mountain, 60 intersections are water, and 240 intersections are plains. In classical Go, with area scoring, each intersection is worth 1 point. However, in Terrain Go, each \(\Delta\) is worth 0 point, each \(\square\) is worth 1.5 points, and each plain is worth 1 point. Additionally, at the beginning, players will take turns placing 3 markings each, called their “forts”, on a “plain” intersection of their choice, which will be indicated by letters. They will each be worth 12 points for the opponent if at the end of the game they end up in the oppoent’s territory (and 0 if it ends up in their own), and once placed, they cannot be captured or removed from the board, or occupied by a stone, or serve as a liberty for another group. Here’s an example of a configuration of the board, where A, B, C are white’s forts, and C, D, E are black’s.</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/goconfig.png" alt="Example Configuration" style="height: 560px; width: 560px;"></p><p>The game will begin with the player who played second in placing the marking, and the rules of capture and Ko, etc, will all follow that of classical Go with the area scoring described above. Additionally, there are special rules for placing stones at moutain or water areas:</p><ol><li>A stone can only be placed at an intersection marked as \(\Delta\) if it will be a part of a group that has at least 1 liberty outside; </li><li>a stone can only be placed at an intersection marked as \(\square\) if it will be a part of a group that has at least 1 stone outside. </li></ol><p>Since the initial position is randomized, we wouldn’t be able to know the appropriate komi, so the initial positions must be checked by an AI program to make sure it is relatively fair for both players, compensating with a small komi for black or white if necessary. </p><h4 id="New-Tactics-and-Strategies"><a href="#New-Tactics-and-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="New Tactics and Strategies"></a>New Tactics and Strategies</h4><p>An obvious consequence of the new rules is that any Joseki/Fuseki are rendered obsolete, thus the player cannot obtain any advantage by pre-memorizing openings. The uneven distribution of value of intersections could also lead to interesting strategies. This is arguably closer to real-life war, in which not all areas are of equal strategic value. I would also imagine that it is probably good strategy to start the game around the forts, which are the most valuable positions. In addition, the special rules for placing stones at mountains and waters could lead to novel life and death situations and local tactics. It is more difficult to traverse water because a stone cannot jump in the water alone, it must connect to an existing group that bridges to land. It is even more difficult to traverse mountains since the opponent could try to eliminate outside liberties easily. Therefore, it is possible, for example, to imagine a position where a group of stones is sorrounded “against” a group of mountains or waters. The reader is welcomed to think about more tactics unique to this variant.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“The introduction of the cipher 0 or the group concept was general nonsense too, and mathematics was more or less stagnating for thousands of years because nobody was around to take such childish steps.” </p><p style="text-align: right;"> Alexander Grothendieck </p></blockquote><p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3072368">paper</a> by Dan Isaksen, which I find very interesting. It shows that even incredibly basic math, such as the way we learned to add integers in elementary school, could be seen from a much deeper and beautifully illuminating light of group cohomology. The original paper is very accessibe, but I still wanted to share this with you in my own exposition. We begin by revisiting the classic  algorthim for adding and subtracting non-negative whole numbers: we align the numbers vertically, we do the operation digit-by-digit, and carrying a \(1\) when the digits add to \(10\) or more. The “carrying” here is the essence, we will see that this could be interpreted as 2-cocycles in a certain group cohomology.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition. Suppose \(Q,N\) are two groups, then an extension group of \(Q\) by \(N\) is a group \(G\) along with a short exact sequence of groups \[\mathbb{1}\rightarrow N \xrightarrow{\  i\ } G\xrightarrow{\ \pi\ }Q\rightarrow \mathbb{1}\]i.e. we have (the image of) \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\) and \(G/N\cong Q\). The extension is said to be a central extension if \(N\) lies in the center of \(G\), a cyclic extension if \(G\) is cyclic, and a split extension if the exact sequence splits, i.e. there exists a map \(\tau:Q\rightarrow G\) such that \(\pi\circ \tau=\mathrm{id}\) (this is a proper generalization of split exact sequences in the category of abelian groups).</p></blockquote><p>The archetypical example in this article is the following. Let \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\) be our simplified model of the classic addition algorithm, which captures carrying from the ones digit to the tens digit, so it will suffice for our purpose. Let \(T\) be the subgroup of \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\) consisting of multiples of \(10\), which we call “tens”, and \(O\) be the quotient group of \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\) by \(T\) which we call the “ones”. Obviously \(T\cong \mathbb Z/10\mathbb Z\cong O\), but we note that they have different relationships to \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\). We then have a short exact sequence \(\mathbb{1}\rightarrow T \hookrightarrow \mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\xrightarrow{\ \pi\ }O\rightarrow \mathbb{1}\), viewed as a group extension. This extension is central, cyclic, but not split. </p><p>In the following, we will work more generally with an arbitrary extension \(G\) of \(Q\) by \(N\), where all these groups are assumed abelian and written additively. We pick a set-theoretic map \(\tau:Q\rightarrow G\) s.t. \(\pi\circ\tau=\mathrm{id}\) and \(\tau(0)=0\), and then we have a (set-theoretic) bijective correspondance \(G\leftrightharpoons N\times Q\) given by \[G\ \xrightleftharpoons[(n,q)\mapsto n+\tau(q)]{g\mapsto (g-\tau(\pi(g)),\pi(g))}\ N\times Q\]</p><p>Bijectivity is easily verified. In the case of the archetypical example, this bijective correspondance \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\leftrightharpoons T\times O\) separates the tens and ones digit, e.g. \(14\mapsto (10,4)\), when \(\tau\) is appropriately chosen. We can then express the new addition function in this form, we could easily calculate as \[(n_1,q_1)+(n_2,q_2)=(n_1+n_2+z(q_1,q_2), q_1+q_2)\] where \(z(q_1,q_2)=\tau(q_1)+\tau(q_2)-\tau(q_1+q_2)\), which we call the carrying function. In the case of our example, we have e.g. \(z(6,7)=10\) and \(z(4,5)=0\), when \(\tau\) is appropriately chosen. More generally,</p><blockquote><p>Definition. We say that a function \(z:Q\times Q\rightarrow N\) is a carrying function if it satisfies </p><ol><li>(cocycle condition) \(z\left(b, c\right)-z\left(a+b, c\right)+z\left(a, b+c\right)-z\left(a, b\right)=0\)</li><li>(normalization condition) \(z(a,0)=z(0,a)=0\)</li></ol></blockquote><p>We can verify that \(z(q_1,q_2)=\tau(q_1)+\tau(q_2)-\tau(q_1+q_2)\) does satisfy these two conditions. The cocycle condition is derived from the associativity of addition, and the normalization condition is easily verified. Conversely, given two abelian groups \(N,Q\) and a (set-theoretic) carrying function \(z:Q\times Q\rightarrow N\), the set \(N\times Q\) with addition \((n_1,q_1)+(n_2,q_2)=(n_1+n_2+z(q_1,q_2), q_1+q_2)\) is a well-defined abelian group. Let \(G\) be this group, then \(G\) is a group extension of \(Q\) by \(N\) in the obvious way. For example, let \(Q=O\) and \(N=T\), and let the carrying function carry 2 when it normally carries 1, then we get the group \(G=\mathbb Z/50\oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z\).</p><p>We saw that an extension gives a carrying function, and a carrying function gives rise to an extension. This correspondance is, however, not bijective. An isomorphism of extension is \(\phi:G\rightarrow G^\prime\) which restricts to the identity map on \(N\rightarrow N^\prime\) and induces isomorphism \(Q\rightarrow Q^\prime\), i.e. an isomorphism must preserve \(N\) and \(Q\). We then have the following</p><blockquote><p>Theorem. Suppose \(G,G^\prime\) are extensions with induced carrying functions \(z,z^\prime\), then TAFE</p><ol><li><p>exists a function \(h:Q\rightarrow N\) s.t. for all \(q_1,q_2\in Q\) \[z(q_1,q_2)-z^\prime(q_1,q_2)=h(q_1)+h(q_2)-h(q_1+q_2)\] and satisfies \(h(0)=0\) </p></li><li><p>\(G\cong G^\prime\) as extensions.</p></li></ol><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>In one direction, define isomorphism \(\phi:G\rightarrow G^\prime\) by \(\phi(n,q)=(n+h(q),q)\), and the rest is a routine check. In the other direction, define \(h\) by the formula \(\phi(0,q)=(h(q),q)\). Then we compare the first component of \(\phi(0,q_1)+\phi(0,q_2)=\phi((0,q_1)+(0,q_2))\)</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>This gives us motivation to link this to group cohomology. We note that the carrying functions are precisely the 2-cocycles, and the RHS are the 2-coboundaries in the group cohomology \(H^2(Q;N)=\operatorname{Ext}^1_{\mathbb{Z}}(Q, N)\). Where \(N\) is a \(Q\)-module acting by conjugation. We can write out explicitly the coboundary map \(d^{2}: C^1(Q, N) \rightarrow C^{2}(Q, N)\) by \((dh)(q_1,q_2)=h(q_1)+h(q_2)-h(q_1+q_2)\), which checks out comparing to the previous calculations. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

It shows that even incredibly basic math, such as the way we learned to add integers in elementary school, could be seen from a much deeper and beautifully illuminating light of group cohomology. The original paper is very accessibe, but I still wanted to share this with you in my own exposition. We begin by revisiting the classic  algorthim for adding and subtracting non-negative whole numbers: we align the numbers vertically, we do the operation digit-by-digit, and carrying a \(1\) when the digits add to \(10\) or more. The “carrying” here is the essence, we will see that this could be interpreted as 2-cocycles in a certain group cohomology.&lt;/p&gt;

Nevertheless, I couldn’t resist the temptation. These ideas have circulated in my mind for too long, and I couldn’t help but share it with others. Therefore, I ask the reader to indulge me in spilling some nonsense, which, in my defense, even if worthless mathematically, may still serve as a fun sci-fi project or thought experiment. The question I’m interested in is the following. Imagine an alien civilization on a distant planet in a solar system millions of lightyears away which is advanced enough to have developed their own “mathematics” (whatever it means). <em>What would their mathematics be like?</em> To break this down into several smaller questions: firstly, what would their formal logical system (to make things interesting, we assume they do use one) be like; secondly, what would the mathematical objects they study be like; and thirdly, what would their theorems be like? </p><span id="more"></span><p>Before we start discussing these questions, allow me to explain why I believe these questions are worth thinking about. In human history, different cultures all developed the notion of natural numbers, albeit obviously having different representations of them. For the Arabs, it’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on, for the Romans, it’s I, II, III, IV, V, VI, and so on. While the Arabic numerals use the position of a symbol to denote its value (place-value system), the Roman numerals have fixed values for each symbol (I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, and so on). They are both fully faithful representations of natural numbers, but some theorems are easier to discover and prove if you are working in the “right” representation. For example, I’d imagine that it would be easier for the Arabs (or any other culture that use place-valued based 10 representation of natural numbers) to discover and prove the theorem that a natural number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, since this theorem is due to the fact that 10 equivalent to 1 modulo 3, which is easier to observe in arabic numbers. Of course, the theorem is still true for roman numbers, as we can easily translate between the two representations. Another example from elementary mathematics is different coordinate systems of the plane, such as Cartesian coordinates vs. polar coordinate. There are many examples from elementary calculus on the plane, which are easier to calculate when you swap to a different coordinate system. Similarly, I think working in the “right” foundations makes some theorems easier to discover and prove. This is already evident in human mathematics. The development of a new foundation of mathematics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory">homotopy type theory</a> (I don’t claim any familiarity with this area, so I could be wrong), has alrady had some impacts on algebraic topology, in particular homotopy theory, as it is a synthetic theory for \(\infty\)-groupoids, an abstract homotopical model for topological spaces, in contrast with traditional set-theoretic foundations à la Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. </p><p>Therefore, you can tell that I actually lied a little in my motivating question: it’s not the aliens I care about. I only phrased the question in terms of aliens as an excuse to provoke thoughts on a body of hypothetical mathematics, along with a foundation thereof, independent of human intuition, experience, and practical needs. You can think of “aliens” as a metaphor for an abstract agent, not necessarily literal aliens living in our universe, capable of advanced reasoning but possibly in a drastically different fasion. Perhaps the foundations we use today, such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, are too successful, which has maybe made us lazy to think about other possibilities. Granted, we have played with many other set theories and type theories, but those are more or less motivated by the mathematics of our species. I firmly believe that there’s a lot more room for exploration, and that if we wish to, we could be much more imaginative in our foundations. Perhaps, unbeknownst to us, there is a foundation of mathematics out there radically different from all foundations we have which could shed light on areas of math in ways we couldn’t fathom yet. On an unrelated note, Michel Demazure once said about Grothendieck, that “I did not view him as I did other great mathematicians, who were made of the same fabric — better fabric, to be sure, as they were brighter, faster, harder workers. Grothendieck always seemed essentially different; he was an ‘alien.’” I think it is worthwhile to adopt a similar attitude: to think like an alien.</p><h4 id="Extraterrestrial-Ethnomathematics"><a href="#Extraterrestrial-Ethnomathematics" class="headerlink" title="Extraterrestrial Ethnomathematics"></a>Extraterrestrial Ethnomathematics</h4><p>I would like to begin with some naïve thoughts, both to reinforce the points I made in the previous paragraphs, and to pave the way for the next section. A fundamental observation is: human experience, intuition, and societal influences, has played a major role in the development of human mathematics, and consequently in human foundations of mathematics. Naturally, one wonders what if these variables are different for the aliens?</p><p>Firstly, what if the aliens experience the world differently? I’d imagine if the alien’s body is made of gas, plasma, or some spooky quantum state matter, they would probably have a much more esoteric perception of the notion of distance. Perhaps even non-archimedean distance is more natural to them? Maybe they discover \(p\)-adic numbers before they discover real numbers? In human history, real numbers and the rigorization of calculus (real analysis) is central to the development of foundations. Perhaps \(p\)-adic numbers would play a similar role in the alien’s development of mathematical foundations, leading to different definitions of these structures? On the other hand, what if the aliens live in a universe where the laws of physics is different? This may affect their concept of many fundamental notions, such as space or shape. Their perceptions of causality may also affect their concept of probability, and so on.</p><p>Secondly, what if the alien’s intuition, that is, the way their brain works, is different? In Liu Cixin’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34569357-remembrance-of-earth-s-past"><em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em></a> scifi trilogy (spoilors!), he described an alien civilization, the trisolarans, who spontaneously and instantaneously communicate their thoughts through electromagnetic waves. To the trisolarans, thinking is the same as speaking, and therefore they have no concept of deception, which gave them a big disadvantage against humans when they invaded earth. Similar things might be true for math. When I was learning algebraic topology for the first time, I found the calculations of fundamental groups and homology groups using Seifert–van Kampen theorem and Mayer–Vietoris sequences particularly interesting. Compared to other proofs I did, they seem to depend highly on pictorial intuition. This kind of intuition is especially common in the study of low-dimensional topology (the studies of knots, braids, and 3- or 4-manifolds), where mathematicians often work with pictorial intuition before writing down rigorous proofs. A general rule seems to be that the more intuition we have of something, the less reliant we are on its formalisms. One could imagine that there might be aliens who are able to perform this kind of informal intuitive argument on higher dimensional or non-archimedean spaces, which we mere humans can only approach with rigorous formalism.</p><p>Thirdly, what if the aliens have different societal influences on mathematics? For example, in human history, the development of various number systems, from \(\mathbb N\), to \(\mathbb Z\), to \(\mathbb Q\), and to \(\mathbb R\), is rooted in our demands for increasingly sophisticated mathematical structures in socioeconomic production such as accounting and engineering. From counting discrete finite things with natural numbers, to including negative and rational numbers for the purpose of representing money, and to including numbers arising in geometry such as \(\pi\) and square roots (arising as length of hypotenuse of right triangles), and so on. An alien society with possibly different socioeconomic demands may lead to a different line of development of number systems, or perhaps they didn’t start with \(\mathbb N\) to begin with! The study of number systems begat the study of abstract rings, hence one could imagine aliens having different axioms for rings. And this could be said about many other mathematical structures and their abstractions. On the other hand, the influence of natural languages (which could be considered a social agreement) in math can’t be ignored. What is fascinating to me is that first-order language bears striking similarities with our natural languages. It’s hard to believe that there isn’t a connection. One expects aliens to have different natural languages, which could influence the syntaxes of their formal languages.</p><p>The more one ponders about these possibilities, the more one realizes that human mathematics is by no means natural or unique epistemologically – there are a lot of things in our math that are rather arbitrary. Aliens could disagree with us on what mathematical objects are more basic, which elaborations of the basic objects are more natural, which body of mathematics is more intuitive, which mathematical structures better capture fundamental notions, and so on. </p><h4 id="The-Universal-Feature"><a href="#The-Universal-Feature" class="headerlink" title="The Universal Feature"></a>The Universal Feature</h4><p>In the previous section, we talked about what could be different for alien math, but a much more fundamental and much more challenging question is, what would be universal among all alien’s (and our) math? Here, I propose a candidate answer to this question: abstractions. We start by looking at the abstractions in human math.</p><p>One subtle thing about natural numbers that perhaps many people don’t realize, probably due to the fact that we are so used to them, is that they are already an abstraction. They are an abstraction of the notion of finite size (as cardinals) or finite well order (as ordinals). Here lets just focus on the former. From an early age we learn to count things with our fingers, but what we are really doing is establishing a bijection between our fingers and the things we are counting. We do this because we realize that counting is the same mechanism regardless of the thing we are counting. Counting our fingers and counting anything else are isomorphic! The natural numbers is the abstraction of this mechanism. It is meaningless to ask if the number \(1\) really exists, just like it is meaningless to ask if \(\sqrt{-1}\) or \(\pi\) or quaternions really exist: they are nothing more than abstractions. Similarly, a set of points equidistant to a fixed point is our abstraction of circles, \(\mathbb Z/12\) is the abstraction of the hour hand on a clock, and so on. This is what I like to call abstraction level 0. Mathematicians realize that a lot of these structures share a lot of things in common. Therefore, we organize them into “types” of objects. Symmetries are studied as “groups”, shapes as “topological spaces”, number systems as “rings”, and so on. This is what I like to call abstraction level 1. Of course, one could go further, abstraction level 2 would be categories, and so on. I should note that abstraction is not the same as generalization; it is a special kind of generalization that takes things to a “higher dimension”, and by doing so, unveils the deeper nature of the object in study. This idea of abstraction is so fundamental that, in some sense, one could argue that abstraction is precisely what characterizes mathematic ontologically. I do not believe that there are aliens who do math by simply generating theorems from axioms using inference rules (and if so, it is debatable what they are doing is actually math). There must be a point where they introduce concepts and definitions of mathematical objects. </p><p>On the other hand, there is the dichotomy of analytic v.s. synthetic mathematics, which arises naturally from abstractions. To oversimplify, analytic methods “break down” things and synthetic methods “put together” things. For example, in elementary Euclidean geometry, the analytic approach to solving problems would be to introduce coordinates and characterize geometric shapes as solutions of polynomial equations. This approach cares more about what the objects of study are “made of”. In this case, they are made of points in Euclidean space satisfying polynomial equations. In contrast, a synthetic approachs would start from something akin to Euclid’s axioms in the <em>Elements</em> or their modern counterparts such as Tarski’s axioms or Hilbert’s axioms. Synthetic approaches don’t care much about what the objects of study are made of, instead they care more about what we can infer from properties already expected. Often times, this synthetic v.s. analytic dichotomy go by the disguise of “definition v.s. example”, “syntax v.s. semantics”, or “axioms v.s. models”. This is something that must arise from abstractions since if we have abstractions then we must also have the dual process of abstraction: specification, the process of endowing concrete models to the abstract descriptions of objects. Formally, this duality can be formulated as a Galois connection (a generalization of the Galois correspondance in the fundamental theorem of Galois theory).</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 1. (Lawvere) Let \(L\) be a language, \(A\) the set of \(L\)-sentences, and \(S\) the set of \(L\)-structures. Define \(\mathcal A\) the poset \(\mathcal P(A)\) w.r.t. inclusion and \(\mathcal S\) the poset \(\mathcal P(S)\) w.r.t. inclusion. Define morphisms</p><ol><li>\(f_{*}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal S\), where \(f_{*}(\alpha)=\{s \mid \forall \varphi\in\alpha, s \vDash \varphi\}\)</li><li>\(f^{*}:\mathcal S\rightarrow \mathcal A\), where \(f^{*}(\sigma)=\{\varphi \mid \forall s\in \sigma, s \vDash \varphi\}\)</li></ol><p>then \(f_{*}\vdash f^{*}\) is a Galois connection, i.e. we have<br>\[f_{*}(\alpha)\subseteq \sigma\Longleftrightarrow\alpha\subseteq f^{*}(\sigma)\] for all \(\alpha\in \mathcal A\) and \(\sigma\in \mathcal S\).</p></blockquote><p>When I first saw this theorem, it immediately reminded me of Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz. Not only are they both Galois connections, but also both “generated” by relations that could be described as “\(a\) satisfies \(b\)” (perhaps it could be named the “logical Nullstellensatz”). I think this shows that the synthetic v.s. analytic adjunction is more than just philosophical – it is also formally mathematical. Therefore, if we assume that abstractions are universal among all alien mathematics, then so must be the case for specification and the synthetic v.s. analytic duality.</p><p>Why is this question of universal feature across alien maths important? I think it is because it is an attempt to peak into what is truely <em>natural</em> in math. Usually, we say something is natural if it doesn’t depend on any arbitrary elements. For example, any isomorphism of vector spaces \(V\rightarrow V^*\) is not natural because it depends on a choice of basis, but map that takes an element to its evaluation map \(V\rightarrow (V^*)^* \) is a natural isomorphism because it doesn’t depend on a choice of basis. Similarly, humans (and likely alien civilizations) have their own arbitrary “choices” in their math, as discussed in a previous section. Therefore, the elements that are universal, which do not depend on the arbitrary elements, would be more natural. A curious question that arises is, if the idea of abstraction is the most natural, is there a “natural foundation” that “only depends” on natural elements, in this case, abstraction?</p><h4 id="A-Natural-Foundation"><a href="#A-Natural-Foundation" class="headerlink" title="A Natural Foundation?"></a>A Natural Foundation?</h4><p>In my first undergraduate class, I learned about Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory – the foundations of (the majority of) modern mathematics. However, I never felt truely convinced by Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. Don’t get me wrong, I have no doubt of its rigor or success as a foundation of mathematics. What I mean is that I get a sense that many things about it are incredibly “awkward” or “unnatural”, for lack of a better word. I’ll only discuss one example: the definition of cardinal numbers. Naïvely, one would define a cardinal number as the following</p><blockquote><p>(Naïve) Definition. <em>A cardinal number is an equivalence class of sets under bijection.</em></p></blockquote><p>Of course, this is ludicrous, we can’t have the natural number 1 be a proper class. The actual definition of cardinal numbers is much more sophisticated: it is an ordinal number not equinumerous as any smaller ordinals, and ordinals are in turn defined as a set strictly well ordered by membership and every subset of which is an element. This definition, due to von Neumann, circumvents the set-theoretic issue by “restricting” the class of sets to its “skeleton”, ordinal numbers, in order to prevent cardinal numbers themselves from being too large. However, I argue that this naïve definition is what captures the idea of cardinals more naturally, because it emphasizes the conceptual meaning of cardinal numbers that they are avatars of the cardinalities of sets. This is not seen in von Neumann’s definition, in which the well-order structure comes first and is substantial to the definition. I was quite surprised to learn that in some type theories, the naïve definition actually works. This means that the crux of this problem really is of a set-theoretic nature. Other difficulties we encounter in set theory are usually of a similar fashion – the limitation comes from something being too large to be a set. For example, in category theory, and especially when higher structures are introduced, there are often meaningful things that could be too large to be a set, such as the functor category \(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C,\mathcal D)\) between two categories. Of course, there are ways to circumvent this, such as restricting things to a Grothendieck universe, but, again, it feels contrived and not as natural as the naïve definition. Why are many of these “awkwardnesses” of this fasion? My guess is, this is because the notion of sets, i.e. a collection, is treat as à priori, and thus encoding other notions, when they are not usually thought of as a collection, as sets would lead to ad hoc modifications i.e. the awkwardnesses, especially when it “ranges over” a proper class.</p><p>In all human math foundations, one common theme  seems to be to build mathematical objects from certain “à priori” or “atomic” or “basic” notions. In set theory, the basic notion is sets (and the basic relation between them, namely membership). Thus, set theory could be considered as a synthetic theory for sets. Everything else is built from sets, even if the mathematical object isn’t usally understood as a collection, e.g. a tuple \((x,y)=\{x,\{x,y\}\}\), a natural number \(2=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\), or a function \(f\subseteq X\times Y\). My guess is, the fact that the naïve definition could work in type theories may be explained by the fact that the basic objects in type theory, namely types, are more intricate. I presume the justification for this philosophy is that it is an easy way to make sure everything is consistent with everything else (at least we hope so since we can’t prove this due to Gödel). And also because, well, we have to start somewhere, don’t we? I concur with this point, but still I’m not fully convinced by this philosophy, and I bet that there are alien civilizations who agree with me on this. The problem I have with it is, none of these “atomic objects” seem “canonical”. The notions of function, relation, and many others seem equally fundamental as the notion of sets, and one could imagine some aliens using “function theory” or “relation theory” as their foundation. It is difficult to assert that any of the notions of “function”, “relation”, “sets”, etc, are more basic than all others. I guess you could also take the utilitarian point of view: it doesn’t matter what the basic object is, as long as it works. However, I find this to be a lazy answer. I’m not satisfied by it. </p><p>This prompted the question: what is the canonical basic notion? First, what makes a notion “basic”? Let’s take a step back and first think about why do people usually consider the notion of collection, i.e. sets, a basic notion? From the Bourbaki point of view, a “mathematical structure” is a set with possible extra structures, such as algebaric structures, topological structures, or order structures, and various combinations of them. A morphism between these structures would be a function of sets preserving said structures, and then we could talk about these objects up to isomorphisms. In this sense, sets are basic because all “mathematical structures” by definition are built from them. However, this point of view is restrictive. Categorically, we have meaningful categories that are not concrete, i.e., doesn’t have a (fully faithful) forgetful functor to \(\mathbf{Set}\). I also don’t believe that the ubiquity of a notion would imply primitivity, eventhough assuming so would be good for practical reasons. From a maybe naïve point of view, a way to approximate primitivity is to see if it could encode all of hitherto human math. In this sense, a lot of other notions, not just sets, could be considered basic. Second, even if we agree on which objects are the more basic, which one is the canonical one? We usually say something is canonical if we deem it to be “archetypical”. This again is a very difficult question. On the syntactical side, take for example the ZFC axioms – some of them are not entirely about sets “as a collection”, such as axioms of infinity and choice. An alien who probably doesn’t know how humans encode functions and natural numbers as sets would be understandably confused why these two axioms would appear in a axiomatic theory for the notion of “collection”. This is in stark contracts with the axioms (or axiom schemas) of extensionality, power set, pairing, union, and specification. Thus, in some sense, ZFC is not canonical either. What then would the canonical basic notion be? Let me take a radical stance at this question: <em>there is no canonical basic notion at all!</em></p><p>Before I attempt to justify this claim, I would like to make a digression from the world of math to the world of the philosophy of science. There is an idea in science relevant to our discussion: reductionism. Reductionism, roughly speaking, is the belief that things can be explained by breaking them down into smaller more fundamental things. A quintessential reductionist belief is, chemistry is just applied physics, biology is just applied chemistry, etc. </p><br><center><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/purity.png" alt="'Purity' by xkcd"><figcaption>"Purity" by xkcd</figcaption></center><p><br>Reductionism has been criticized by many, but most famously by theoretical physicist P. W. Anderson in his <em>More is Different</em>. In a nutshell, Anderson argues that “the main fallacy of this idea is that the reductionist hypothesis does not by any means imply a constructionist one: the ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe.” This is not entirely irrelevant to our discussion. I argue that, simiar to empiracal sciences, the fact that we can reduce mathematical structures to more basic constructions, in the sense of analytic methods, doesn’t imply that we could start from the “most basic notion” and build <em>everything</em> on top, i.e. to implement all mathematics in some synthetic theory of a basic notion. Here, the meanings of “everything” and “all mathematics” are quite subtle. Let’s not get into the philosophical debate of whether mathematics exists outside foundations, and take the word to mean the collection of all math devised by all possible abstract alien civilizations. This hypothesis explains why we find it difficult to find a canonical basic notion – it may not exist.</p><p>But if we don’t do this, how do we ensure one mathematical theory works well with another? After all, almost all mathematial theories are intertwined and interconnected with each other. Ay, there’s the rub! I believe what we could possibly attempt is to create an intricate metaframework machinery across all possible  theories, with details on how they work together in a natural way. This would be in contrast with set theory, where we work inside the synthetic theory of sets and add axioms to allow for construction of all other things using sets. Initially, I was inclined to call this idea a possibility for “universal foundation”, but I realized that this is not the most accurate word. What I’m postulating is not exactly “universal” in the sense of universal properties. I’m not asking for a foundation that subsumes all others, or one through which all others factor. Instead, it is a metaframework. As an analogy, I would say this is more like gluing up local coordinate charts to form a manifold, or gluing up affine schemes with a sheaf to form a scheme. In contrast with orthodox ways, where the edifice of math stands upon a solid agreed-upon base, this would be more base-free (or coordinate-free in the analogy). In other words, instead of having an absolute foundation, we adopt a relative point of view like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck%27s_relative_point_of_view">that of Grothendieck’s</a>. I am aware that this task seems highly unrealistic to the point of despair, but again, this is just brainstorming. Brainstorming never hurts! If such an idea is not entirely my own idiotic fantasy, would it be considered a “natural foundation”? Well, that I’m not qualified to judge. But I think that even if it existed, it wouldn’t supersede traditional set-theoretic foundations, at least pedagogically. Nevertheless, I’d like to think more about it when I have better mathematical maturity. I think this is a good point for me to stop rambling my nonsense. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

Imagine an alien civilization on a distant planet in a solar system millions of lightyears away which is advanced enough to have developed their own “mathematics” (whatever it means). &lt;em&gt;What would their mathematics be like?&lt;/em&gt; To break this down into several smaller questions: firstly, what would their formal logical system (to make things interesting, we assume they do use one) be like; secondly, what would the mathematical objects they study be like; and thirdly, what would their theorems be like? &lt;/p&gt;

In one respect this last point is accurate.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> David Mumford </p></blockquote><p>Continuing last week, we are finally going to define the derived category \(D(\mathcal A)\) for an abelian category \(\mathcal A\). Before we actually do that, we need to introduce localization of categories, and we will define the derived category in terms of a localization of the homotopy category of complexes. Localization of categories is very analogous to localization of rings or modules. Given any category (with no assumption of abelian, additive, triangulated, etc), we formally invert a class of morphisms. We will give one definition in terms of a localization construction and show that it is unsatisfactory in that it does not have a lot of useful and desirable properties. We will then develop a better description of derived categories in terms of roofs.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition 1. Let \(\mathcal A\) be a category and \(S\) a class of morphisms of it, then define its localization as a category \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) and a functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow A[S^{-1}]\) s.t. \(Q(s)\) is an isomorphism for all \(s\in S\) and \(Q\) is universal w.r.t. this property, i.e. if the functor \(F:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is such that \(F(s)\) is an isomorphism for each \(s\), then there exists a unique functor \(G:\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\rightarrow\mathcal B\) s.t. \(F=G\circ Q\). </p></blockquote><p>The way we obtain a construction that satisfies this universal property is quite convoluted. We define it this way. Let \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) have the same objects as \(\mathcal A\). For each \(X,Y\in\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\), let a directed edge between them be a morphism \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\) or if \(s\in S\cap \mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\), an edge in the opposite direction \(s:Y\rightarrow X\). A path between two objects \(M,N\in A[S^{-1}]\) is a sequence of directed edges \(M=L_0, L_1,\dots,L_n=N\), where the direction does not need to be the same. We define \(\mathrm{Hom}(M,N)\) as the equivalence class of paths where two paths are equivalent if they can be transformed to each other via a sequence of the following transformations.</p><ol><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{f}Y\xrightarrow{g}Z\), replace with \(X\xrightarrow{gf}Z\),</li><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{s} Y\xleftarrow{s}X\) where \(s\in S\), replace with \(X\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_X} X\),</li><li>for \(Y\xleftarrow{s} X\xrightarrow{s}Y\) where \(s\in S\), replace with \(Y\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_Y} Y\),</li><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_X}X\xleftarrow{s} Y\), replace with \(X\xleftarrow{s}Y\)</li></ol><p>Long story short, this is a well defined equivalence relation, so it forms a category where composition is concatonation. For the localization functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A[S^{-1}]\), it sends objects to themselves, and morphisms to the equivalence class with the path being the single morphism. Here we should give extra care that the arrows can some times mean directed edges, and is \(Y\leftarrow X\) can mean a path from \(Y\) to \(X\), only with the directed edge in the opposite direction. We can verify that this indeed satisfies the universal property of localization. We may also check that by this localization construciton, one can write morphisms in the form \[\left(Q\left(f_1\right) \circ Q\left(s_1\right)^{-1}\right) \circ \cdots \circ\left(Q\left(f_n\right) \circ Q\left(s_n\right)^{-1}\right)\] where \(s_i\in S\).

In fact a ring can be viewed as an additive category (by delooping). The localizing classes are classes of “nice” morphisms to localize at for which we could develop a description of roofs.</p><p>For a category \(\mathcal A\) and a localizing class \(S\). A morphism \(Q(f)\circ Q(s)^{-1}\) in \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) is represented by a left roof, which is a diagram \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\), and a morphism \(Q(t)^{-1}\circ Q(g)\) with \(t\in S\) is represented by a right roof which is a diagram \(M\xrightarrow{g}L\xleftarrow{t}N\). We say that the two left roofs \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\) and \(M\xleftarrow{t}K\xrightarrow{g}N\) are equivalent if there exists \(p:H\rightarrow L\) and \(q:H\rightarrow K\) such that \(sp,tq\in S\) and the diagram <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNSxbMiwwLCJIIl0sWzEsMSwiTCJdLFszLDEsIksiXSxbMCwyLCJNIl0sWzQsMiwiTiJdLFswLDEsInAiLDJdLFswLDIsInEiXSxbMSwzLCJzIiwyXSxbMiw0LCJnIl0sWzIsMywidCJdLFsxLDQsImYiLDJdXQ==&embed" width="350" height="250" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> commutes. We can show that this is an equivalence relation. The only difficult part is transitivity. This can be done using a diagram chasing argument. We can also define composition of roofs. The composition of the previous two roofs is defined as a composition of the diagram <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNixbMiwwLCJVIl0sWzEsMSwiTCJdLFszLDEsIksiXSxbMCwyLCJNIl0sWzIsMiwiTiJdLFs0LDIsIlAiXSxbMCwxLCJsIiwyXSxbMCwyLCJrIl0sWzEsMywicyIsMl0sWzEsNCwiZiJdLFsyLDQsInQiLDJdLFsyLDUsImciXV0=&embed" width="350" height="250" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> where \(U\) and the associated maps are induced from the fact that \(S\) is a localizing class. We could check that these satisfies all the desirable properties of a composition. Composition respects equivalence of roofs, is associative, and has an identity given by \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf{1}_M} M\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_M} M\). One can check that the category of (equivalence classes of) left roofs \(\mathcal A_S\) is equivalent to right roofs, so we might as well just work with left roofs. We define a functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A_S\) by letting it be identity on objects and for each morphism \(f:M\rightarrow N\), let \(Q(f)\) be the equivalence class of roofs \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf 1_M}M\xrightarrow{f} N\). This satisfies the universal property of localization, hence isomorphic to \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\).</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 2. For \(S\) a localizing class of category \(\mathcal A\), the category \(\mathcal A_S\) and functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A_S\) satisfies the universal property of localization, i.e. \(Q(s)\) is an isomorphism for each \(s\in S\) and is universal w.r.t. it.</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>For the first property, \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf{1}_M}M\xrightarrow{s}N\) has an inverse \(N\xleftarrow{s}M\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_M}M\). Next, suppose \(F:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal B\) is such that \(F(s)\) is an isomorphism for all \(s\in S\), define functor \(G:\mathcal A_S\rightarrow \mathcal B\) as identity on objects, and for morphisms, the following. If \(\phi:M\rightarrow N\) in \(\mathcal A_S\), choose a representing roof \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\), and define \(G(\phi)=F(f)\circ F(s)^{-1}\). It’s not immediately obvious that this is well defined on equivalence classes, but we omit the verification. This obviously satisfies \(F=G\circ Q\). It is left to the reader to verify that \(G\) respects composition, which is the last piece of verification necessary.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>If \(\mathcal A\) is an additive category, then localizing it would also have an additive structure. In fact if \(\mathcal A\) is additive, we may restate the last axiom of localizing class as: for \(f:M\rightarrow N\) exists \(\exists s\in S, sf=0\Longleftrightarrow \exists t\in S, tf=0\). And the inherited additive structure is the obvious one. It is not trivial to check that it is well defined, but again we ommit the verification. Again everything works out as we expected, biproducts, zero objects are preserved, and localization functor is additive. We can also check that \(f=0\) in the localization iff exists \(t\in S\) with \(tf=0\) iff exists \(t\in S\) with \(ft=0\), and \(M=\mathbf 0\) in the localization iff exists \(N\in\mathcal A\) with \((N\xrightarrow{0}M)\in S\) iff exists \(N\in\mathcal A\) with \((M\xrightarrow{0}N)\in S\). These are easy to prove and left as an exercise. Similarly, one can show the localization of abelian categories is abelian. </p><p>Given a triangulated category, a natural question to ask is: when is a localization of it also triangulated? In other words, when is the localizing class compatible with triangulation? For a localizing class \(S\) in the triangulated category \(\mathcal C\), the localization is compatible with triangulation if the following conditions hold</p><ol><li>for each morphism \(f\), we have \(f\in S\) iff \(f[1]\) in \(S\).</li><li>a diagram with \(s,t\in S\) and distinguished rows <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsOCxbMCwwLCJYIl0sWzEsMCwiWSJdLFsyLDAsIloiXSxbMywwLCJYWzFdIl0sWzAsMSwiWF5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzEsMSwiWV5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzIsMSwiWl5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzMsMSwiWF5cXHByaW1lWzFdIl0sWzAsNCwicyJdLFsxLDUsInQiXSxbMiw2LCJ1IiwwLHsic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV0sWzMsNywic1sxXSJdLFswLDFdLFsxLDJdLFsyLDNdLFs0LDVdLFs1LDZdLFs2LDddXQ==&embed" width="300" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> can be completed to a morphism of distinguished triangles. </li></ol><p>We can show that if these conditions hold then the localization \(\mathcal C[S^{-1}]\) inherits the triangulated structure \(QT_{\mathcal C}\), and a triangle is distinguished if it is isomorphic to an image of a distinguished triangle.

They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don’t really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories.

Every semisimple abelian category has a triangulated structure. To do this, we let the translation functor be the identity functor, and we declare a triangle \(X\xrightarrow{u} Y\xrightarrow{v} Z\xrightarrow{w} X\) distinguished if it is “exact” at \(X\), i.e. \(\mathrm{Ker}(u)=\mathrm{Im}(w)\). Verifying this is a triangulated category is a tedious, and we will not do it here. Moreover, all abelian triangulated categories are semisimple. We will not prove this either. In fact, the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\) is triangulated. To see this, we set the distinguished triangles to be the ones isomorphic to a standard triangle of the form \[X^\bullet\xrightarrow{f^\bullet} Y^\bullet \xrightarrow{i_f^\bullet} \mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\xrightarrow{p_f^\bullet} X^\bullet[1]\] and as expected, the cohomology functor \(H^n:K(\mathcal A)\rightarrow\mathcal A\) is cohomological.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Continuing last week where we defined the homotopy category of complexes, we will take a look at triangulated categories. This will help us build towards the definition of derived categories. In some sense, triangulated categories are approximations of abelian categories. They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don’t really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories. Instead of kernels, cokernels, and strict morphisms, triangulated categories bypass these notions and start out with “distinguished triangles”, which are similar to exact sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, I read from the wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry">homological mirror symmetry</a> that the derived category of coherent sheaves is a popular research topic in algebraic geometry. Also, I’ve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don’t understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\).</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition 1.

An <em>additive functor</em> \(\mathcal F:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal D\) between additive categories is a functor such that the associated map \(\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\rightarrow \mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal F(A),\mathcal F(B))\) is a group homomorphism for each \(A,B\in\mathcal C\). Moreover, we denote by \(0_{A,B}\) (or \(0\) if there is no confusion) the identity element of \(\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\).</p></blockquote><p>Note \(0_{A,B}\) is the zero morphism since it’s the unique morphism \(A\rightarrow B\) which factors through \(\mathbf 0\), i.e. \(A\rightarrow\mathbf 0\rightarrow B\).  In particular, note that \(0_{A,B}\circ f=0_{X,A}\) and \(g\circ 0_{A,B}=0_{B,X}\) for any \(f:X\rightarrow A\) and \(g:B\rightarrow X\), for any object \(X\). We note that equivalently, an additive functor maybe defined as a functor that preserves all finite biproducts.</p><p>We recall that in a category \(\mathcal C\), the equalizer \(\mathrm{Eq}(f,g)\) of morphisms \(f,g:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(E\in\mathcal C\) and a morphism \(e:E\rightarrow A\) s.t. the diagram \(E\rightarrow A\rightrightarrows B\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. Dually, the coequalizer \(\mathrm{Coeq}(f,g)\) is an object \(Q\in\mathcal C\) and a morphism \(q:B\rightarrow Q\) s.t. the diagram \( A\rightrightarrows B\rightarrow Q\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. In an additive category, for a morphism \(f:A\rightarrow B\), define its kernel \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)=\mathrm{Eq}(f,0_{A,B})\), cokernel \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)=\mathrm{Coeq}(f,0_{A,B})\). Spelled out explicitly, a kernel of \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(K\) and a morphism \(k:K\rightarrow A\) such that \(f\circ k=0_{K,B}\), and given any \(K^\prime\) and \(k^\prime:K^\prime\rightarrow A\) with \(f\circ k^\prime=0_{K^\prime,B}\), there exists unique \(u:K^\prime\rightarrow K\) s.t. \(k\circ u=k^\prime\).</p><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMSwwLCJBIl0sWzIsMCwiQiJdLFswLDAsIksiXSxbMCwxLCJLXlxccHJpbWUiXSxbMCwxLCJmIl0sWzIsMCwiayJdLFsyLDEsIjBfe0ssQn0iLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMywwLCJrXlxccHJpbWUiLDIseyJsYWJlbF9wb3NpdGlvbiI6NjB9XSxbMywxLCIwX3tLXlxccHJpbWUsQn0iLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6Mn1dLFszLDIsInUiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XV0=&embed" height="190" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe><p>Dually, a cokernel of \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(Q\) with a morphism \(q:B\rightarrow Q\) with \(q\circ f=0_{A,Q}\), such that for any object \(Q^\prime\) and morphism \(q^\prime:B\rightarrow Q\) with \(q^\prime\circ f=0_{A,Q^\prime}\), there exists unique \(u:Q\rightarrow Q^\prime\) such that \(q^\prime=u\circ q\).</p><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJBIl0sWzEsMCwiQiJdLFsyLDAsIlEiXSxbMiwxLCJRXlxccHJpbWUiXSxbMCwxLCJmIl0sWzEsMiwicSJdLFsxLDMsInFeXFxwcmltZSIsMl0sWzIsMywidSIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImJvZHkiOnsibmFtZSI6ImRhc2hlZCJ9fX1dLFswLDIsIjBfe0EsUX0iLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMCwzLCIwX3tBLFFeXFxwcmltZX0iLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6Mn1dXQ==&embed" height="190" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe><p>Recall a subobject of an object \(X\) is an object \(A\) with a monomorphism \(A\hookrightarrow X\), and a quotient object of \(X\) is an object \(Q\) with an epimorphism \(X\twoheadrightarrow Q\).

In fact, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%27s_embedding_theorem">Freyd–Mitchell embedding theorem</a> states that any abelian category can be embedded to the category of \(R\)-modules for some \(R\) via a fully faithful functor. So we may use element-wise diagram chasing in abelian categories, which may help us derive diagram chasing theorems such as \(5\)-lemma and snake lemma. In an abelian category, all finite limits and colimits exist, in particular, pullbacks exist and they preserve monomorphisms and epimorphisms. </p><blockquote><p>Lemma 3.

First, we have \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\rightarrow Y\) is zero and \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\) is zero, so we have a factorization \(X\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow Y\) by the universal property of cokernels. It remains to show that \(\beta:\mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow Y\) is a monomorphism. Suppose \(\varphi_1,\varphi_2:Z\rightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\) with \(\beta\circ \varphi_1=\beta\circ \varphi_2\), therefore \(\beta\circ \sigma=0\) where \(\sigma=\varphi_1-\varphi_2\). Consider the pullback \(W=X\times_{\mathrm{Coim}(f)}Z\) with \(\tau:W\rightarrow Z\) and \(\pi:W\rightarrow X\) of the maps \(\mathrm{Coim}(f)\) and \(\sigma\). We note that \(f\circ\pi=\beta\circ\mathrm{Coim}(f)\circ \pi=\beta\circ\sigma\circ\tau=0\), so \(\pi\) factors through \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\) by \(W\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\) say \(w:W\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(f)\). Therefore, \(\sigma\circ\tau=\mathrm{Coim}(f)\circ \mathrm{Ker}(f)\circ w=0\circ w=0\). Since pullbacks preserve epimorphisms, \(\tau\) is epic.

We denote by \(\overline{f}:\mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow \mathrm{Im}(f)\) the map induced by this factorization, and say \(f\) is <em>strict</em> if \(\overline{f}\) is an isomorphism. </p><!-- --><blockquote><p>Theorem 4.

Since \(\mathrm{Coim}(f)\hookrightarrow B\) is monic, it is the kernel of its cokernel, so it is the kernel of \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)\). Since \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\) in our construction is also the kernel of \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)\), the induced map \(\overline{f}\) is an isomorphism by the universal property of kernels.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>In an abelian category, suppose \(f:A\rightarrow B\) and \(g:B\rightarrow C\) are such that \(g\circ f=0\).

If \(\mathcal A\) is additive, then \(C(\mathcal A)\) inherits an obvious group structure on its morphisms, and they make it an additive category as well. Also, if \(\mathcal A\) is abelian then so is \(C(\mathcal A)\). Let \(C^+(\mathcal A)\) be the full subcategory of \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded below (exists \(N\in\mathbb Z\) s.t. \(A^i=\mathbb 0\) for \(i &lt; N \)), and similarly \(C^-(\mathcal A)\) is the full subcategory \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded above.

In fact, for a chain map \(f^\bullet: A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\), we associate an induced morphism \(H^nf^\bullet:H^n(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(B^\bullet)\), which makes \(H^n\) an additive functor \(C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow\mathcal A\). Moreover, \(f^\bullet\) is said to be a <em>quasi-isomorphism</em> if \(H^nf^\bullet\) is an isomorphism for all \(n\in\mathbb Z\).</p></blockquote><p>Let \(\mathcal A\) be an abelian category. The <em>translation functor</em> \(T:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C(\mathcal A)\) sends a complex \(A^\bullet =(A^i,d^i)\) to the complex \(T(A^\bullet) =(A^{i+1},-d^{i+1})\), and \(T(f^\bullet):T(A^\bullet)\rightarrow T(B^\bullet)\) for \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is given by \(T(f^\bullet)^i=f^{i+1}\). The functor essentially shifts the complex left by one, where the negative sign of the differential is a convention useful later. We denote by \(A^\bullet[n]=T^n(A^\bullet)\) for \(n\in\mathbb Z\) (negative integers correspond to right translations). The right truncation functor \(\tau_{\le n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C^-(\mathcal A)\) sends a complex in the following way <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMTAsWzIsMCwiQV5uIl0sWzIsMSwiXFxtYXRocm17S2VyfShkXntufSkiXSxbMSwwLCJBXntuLTF9Il0sWzMsMCwiQV57bisxfSJdLFsxLDEsIkFee24tMX0iXSxbMywxLCJcXG1hdGhiZnswfSJdLFs0LDAsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbMCwwLCJcXGNkb3RzIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxjZG90cyJdLFs0LDEsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbMCwxLCIiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJ0YWlsIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJtYXBzIHRvIn19fV0sWzIsMF0sWzAsM10sWzQsMSwiIiwyLHsiY29sb3VyIjpbMCw2MCw2MF19XSxbMSw1XSxbMyw2XSxbNywyXSxbOCw0XSxbNSw5XV0=&embed" width="375" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> where the red arrow is induced via universal property. The functor \(\tau_{\le n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow \mathcal A\) sends the morphisms in the obvious way. Moreover, we have a canonical monomorphism \(\tau_{\le n}(A^\bullet)\rightarrow A^\bullet\) which induces isomorphisms on their cohomology objects. The left truncation functor \(\tau_{\ge n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C^+(\mathcal A)\) is defined dually. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 6. Suppose \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is a morphism in \(C(\mathcal A)\) for some abelian category \(\mathcal A\). The <em>cone</em> of \(f^\bullet\) is \(\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)=A^\bullet[1]\oplus B^\bullet\). Spelled out explicitly, the cochain complex consists of objects \(A^{n+1}\oplus B^n\), and the differential \(d^n:A^{n+1}\oplus B^n\rightarrow A^{n+2}\oplus B^{n+1}\) is given by<br>\[d^n=\begin{pmatrix}-d_{A^\bullet}^{n+1}&amp;0\\ f^{n+1}&amp; d_{B^\bullet}^n\end{pmatrix}\]acting as though on column vectors.</p></blockquote><p>We remark that a short exact sequence of complexes induces a long exact sequence of cohomology. Say we have<br>\[\mathbf 0\longrightarrow A^{\bullet}\xrightarrow{\ f^{\bullet}\ } B^\bullet\xrightarrow{\ g^\bullet\ }  C^\bullet\longrightarrow\mathbf 0\]a short exact sequence of complexes, then for each \(n\), exists \(\delta^n:H^n(C^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(A^\bullet)\) making<br>\[\cdots\rightarrow H^n(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(B^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(C^\bullet)\xrightarrow{\delta^n} H^{n+1}(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(B^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(C^\bullet)\rightarrow\cdots\]exact. This is a very common construction in homological algebra, and the way we construct these connecting morphisms is by applying the snake lemma twice. Suppose \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is a chain map with cone \(C^\bullet=\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\), then the map \(<br>\iota^{n}=0 \oplus \operatorname{Id}_{B^{n}}: B^{n} \rightarrow C^{n}<br>\) and the canonical projection \(\rho^n:C^n\rightarrow A^{n+1}\) gives chain maps \(\iota^\bullet:B^\bullet\rightarrow C^\bullet\) and \(\rho^\bullet:C^\bullet \rightarrow A^\bullet [1]\) which fits into a short exact sequence \[\mathbf 0\longrightarrow B^{\bullet}\xrightarrow{\ \iota^{\bullet}\ } C^\bullet\xrightarrow{\ \rho^\bullet\ }  A^\bullet[1]\longrightarrow\mathbf 0\]Hence this induces a long exact sequence on cohomology objects. Working out the connecting morphism, we find out that the connecting morphisms are nothing more than the induced morphisms \(\delta^n=H^{n+1}f^\bullet\). From this fact, we deduce that \(f^\bullet\) is a quasi-isomorphism iff the cone \(\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\) is acyclic. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 7. Suppose \(\mathcal A\) is an abelian category. An object \(X\) in \(\mathcal A\) is <em>injective</em> (resp. <em>projective</em>) if the contravariant (resp. covariant) left exact (resp. right exact) hom-functor \(\mathrm{Hom}(-,X):\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathbf{Ab}\) (resp. \(\mathrm{Hom}(X,-):\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathbf{Ab}\)) is exact. Moreover, we say \(\mathcal A\) has <em>enough injectives</em> (resp. <em>enough projectives</em>) if for any object \(Y\) there is an injective object (resp. projective object) \(X\) and a monomorphism \(Y\rightarrow X\) (resp. epimorphism \(X\rightarrow Y\)). An <em>injective resolution</em> of an object \(X\) is a complex \(I^\bullet\) bounded below \(0\) and a quasi-isomorphism \(X\rightarrow I^\bullet\), or equivalently, an exact sequence<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow X\rightarrow I^0\rightarrow I^1\rightarrow \cdots\]where each \(I^i\) is injective. Dually, a <em>projective resolution</em> of an object \(X\) is a complex \(P_\bullet\) bounded above \(0\) and a quasi-isomorphism \(P_\bullet\rightarrow X\), or equivalently, an exact sequence\[\cdots\rightarrow P_1\rightarrow P_0\rightarrow X\rightarrow \mathbf 0\]where each \(P_i\) is projective.</p></blockquote><p>It is a familiar result in homological algebra that if an abelian category has enough injectives (resp. enough projectives) then every object has an injective resolution (resp. projective resolution). Moreover, given a long exact sequence \(\mathbf 0\rightarrow X\rightarrow M^\bullet\) and an injective resolution of \(I^\bullet\) of \(Y\), then every \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) extends to a chain map <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMTAsWzAsMCwiXFxtYXRoYmZ7MH0iXSxbMSwwLCJYIl0sWzIsMCwiTV4wIl0sWzMsMCwiTV4xIl0sWzQsMCwiXFxjZG90cyJdLFswLDEsIlxcbWF0aGJmezB9Il0sWzEsMSwiWSJdLFsyLDEsIkleMCJdLFszLDEsIkleMSJdLFs0LDEsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbMCwxXSxbMSwyXSxbMiwzXSxbMyw0XSxbNSw2XSxbNiw3XSxbNyw4XSxbOCw5XSxbMSw2LCJmIiwyXSxbMiw3LCIiLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XSxbMyw4LCIiLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XV0=&embed" width="375" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> and two such construction of chain maps are homotopic.

This implies that additive functors take split exact sequences to split exact sequences.<br>Suppose \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is a left exact functor betweeen abelian categories, then applying \(\mathscr{F}\) to a short exact sequence \(\mathbf 0\rightarrow A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\) gives a short exact sequence \(\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(C)\). A natural question to ask is whether we could continue this exact sequence to the right. It turns out that there is a canonical way of doing so, by defining the right derived functors \(R^i\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal B\), we may continue the exact sequence<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(C)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(C)\rightarrow\cdots\]Note that \(\mathscr{F}\) is exact iff \(R^1\mathscr{F}=0\), so in a sense the right derived functors measures how far \(\mathscr{F}\) is from exact.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 8. Let \(\mathcal A,\mathcal B\) be abelian categories and \(\mathcal A\) has enough injectives. Suppose \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is a left-exact functor. Let \(X\in\mathcal A\) and suppose \(I^\bullet\) is an injective resolution, then we obtain a complex<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(I^0)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(I^1)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(I^2)\rightarrow\cdots\]Define the right derived functors as the additive functors \(R^i\mathscr{F};\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\)<br>\[R^i\mathscr{F}(X)=H^i(\mathscr{F}I^\bullet)\]for \(i\ge 0\). Left derived functors \(L_i\mathscr{F}\) are defined dually via projective resolution.</p></blockquote><p>The most important examples of derived functors are the Ext and Tor functors. The Ext functor is the right derived functor of the hom-functor, and the Tor functor is the left derived functor of tensor product. Recall that there is a tensor-Hom adjunction \(\mathrm{Hom}(Y\otimes X,Z)\cong \mathrm{Hom}(Y,\mathrm{Hom}(X,Z))\), so these functors are related very closely.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 9. For \(A,B\in \mathbf{Mod}_R\), define the Ext functors\[\begin{aligned}\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(A,B)&amp;=(R^i\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,-))(B)\\ &amp;\cong (R^i\mathrm{Hom}_R(-,B))(A)\end{aligned} \] and the Tor functors \[\begin{aligned}\mathrm{Tor}_i^R(A,B)&amp;= (L_i(A\otimes_R -))(B)\\ &amp;\cong (L_i(-\otimes_R B))(A)\end{aligned}\] for all \(i\ge 0\).</p></blockquote><!--- --><blockquote><p>Example 10. Derived functors can help us defined many (co)homology theory.</p><ol><li><em>Sheaf cohomology.</em> Let \(X\) be a topological space, then the global section functor \(\Gamma:\mathrm{Sh}(X)\rightarrow \mathbf{Ab}\) which sends \(\mathscr{F} \mapsto \mathscr{F}(X)\) is left exact, its right derived functor \(H^i(X,-):\mathrm{Sh}(X)\rightarrow \mathbf{Ab}\) is the <em>sheaf cohomology</em> \(H^i(X,\mathscr{F})\). Its special cases include the de Rham cohomology. </li><li><em>Group cohomology.</em> Let \(k\) be an algebraically closed field and \(G\) a group, then the invariant functor \((-)^G:\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\rightarrow\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\), which is the same as \(\mathrm{Hom}_{k[G]}(k,-)\), is left exact, its right derived functor \(H^i(G;-):\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\rightarrow\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\) gives the group cohomology \(H^i(G;M)=\mathrm{Ext}^i_{k[G]}(k,M)\).</li><li><em>Hochschild cohomology.</em> This one I’m not really familiar, so I will not write about it in detail.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The derived functors are natural in the sense that if we have a morphism of two short exact sequence in \(\mathcal A\), then the induced morphisms of the long exact sequences in \(\mathcal B\) commutes with the long exact sequences. Finally, I’d like to finish with the definition of the homotopy category of complexes. We say that a chain map is <em>nullhomotopic</em> if it is homotopic to the zero chain.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 11. Let \(\mathcal A\) be an abelian category, the <em>homotopy category of complexes</em> \( K(\mathcal A)\) is the category where objects are (co)chain complexes in \(\mathcal A\) and morphisms are chain maps up to homotopy, i.e. \[\mathrm{Hom}_{K(\mathcal A)}(A^\bullet,B^\bullet)=\mathrm{Hom}_{C(\mathcal A)}(A^\bullet,B^\bullet)/G\] where \(G\) is the subgroup of nullhomotopic chain maps.</p></blockquote><p>There are many things that needs to be checked here for it to be well defined, which we omit. We will see that this category is not typically abelian, but it is triangulated. A triangulated category is an approximation of an abelian category.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;I have always been curious about derived categories. In particular, I read from the wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry&quot;&gt;homological mirror symmetry&lt;/a&gt; that the derived category of coherent sheaves is a popular research topic in algebraic geometry. Also, I’ve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don’t understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\).&lt;/p&gt;

Because they were talking about blowing up six points on the plane.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Anonymous </p></blockquote><p>I spent my last week in Quebec attending the <a href="https://cumc.math.ca/2022/presentation-database">Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2022</a>. It was really an intense week of learning. I learned a lot and met many smart and interesting people. So I wanted to write about the things I learned and the people I met during the conference. There were so many excellent talks but unfortunately I could only attend some of them. In particular, there are some very good ones in geometry, topology, representation theory, algebra, logic theory, etc.<br><span id="more"></span></p><ol><li><em>When Polynomials don’t Commute: An Introduction to Ore Extensions</em> by Nick Priebe. Non-commutative algebra is a central topic in modern algebra research, which concerns objects such as non-commutative rings. Suppose \(R\) is a ring, \(\sigma:R\rightarrow R\) a homomorphism, \(\delta:R\rightarrow R\) a \(\sigma\)-derivation i.e. a homomorphism s.t. \(\delta(rs)=\sigma(r)\delta(s)+\delta(r)s\), then an <em>Ore extension</em> or a <em>skew polynomial ring</em> is the noncommutative ring \(R[x;\sigma,\delta]\) where the multiplication satisfies \(xr=\sigma(r)x+\delta(r)\). Nick provided some examples of noncommutative rings that are useful in physics. He also introduced some basic results and open problems about their representations. I am actually quite curious about the relationship between noncommutative algebra and noncommutative geometry.</li><li><em>A Brief Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory</em> by Jacob Ender. Homotopy type theory is a new foundation of mathematics which is developed from intuitionist type theory. In HoTT, the fundamental objects are types, and we can build dependent types with \(\sum_{(x:A)}B(x)\) (analogue of \(\exists x\in A,B(x)\)) and \(\prod_{(x:A)}B(x)\) (analogue of \(\forall x\in A,B(x)\)). To avoid Russell’s paradox, we can build a tower of universes. Jacob also introduced Voevodsky’s Univalence axiom \((A= B)\simeq (A\simeq B)\) so isomorphic objects are equal. HoTT is very analogous to homotopy theory in the sense of its \(\infty\)-groupoid structure. Currently there is a lot of research in their higher-categorical models and their application in computer proof assistants.</li><li><em>Waring Squaring</em> by Maya Gusak. A classical result in number theory is that each natural number is the sum of at most four squares. Waring’s problem asks for which \(k\in\mathbb N\) exists \(s\in\mathbb Z^+\) s.t. each \(n\in\mathbb N\) can be written as a sum \(n=n_1^k+n_2^k+\cdots+n_s^k\), where \(n_1,\dots,n_s\in\mathbb N\). To tackle this problem, mathematicians used so called circle method. Additionally, this method can be used to prove Vinogradov’s theorem (every odd natural number \(n&gt;5\) is the sum of three primes), but fails to solve Goldbach conjecture.</li><li><em>ADE Classification for Quivers of Finite Representation Type</em> by Xinrui You. A quiver is a multidigraph (i.e. a directed graph with multiple edges and loops allowed) which simulates underlying structure of a category. A representation of a quiver sends each vertex to a vector space or a module and each edge to a morphism. These representations decompose just as representations of finite groups. One fundamental result in the classification of quivers is Gabriel’s theorem. Gabriel’s theorem says that a quiver of finite representation type is a union of Dynkin graphs of type A, D, or E. </li><li><em>The Nash Embedding Theorem for Tori in \(3\)-space</em> by Diba Heydary. A fundamental result in Riemannian geometry is that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically (preserving the length of every path) embedded into a Euclidean space. Diba talked about a specific example of an embedding of a torus in the Euclidean \(3\)-space. A torus has a polygonal representation which can be used to create this embedding. Whitney embedding theorem is a similar result for differentiable manifolds.</li><li><em>Dissection of Polyhedra and the Dehn invariant</em> by James Bona-Landry. The Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem says that that two polygons can be dissected and transformed to each other iff they have the same area. The natural generalization of this question into \(3\) dimensions does not hold. This is due to the Dehn invariant \(\sum_i\ell_i\otimes \theta_i\in \mathbb R\otimes (\mathbb R/2\pi \mathbb Z)\). We can show that there are polyhedra that share same volume but has different Dehn invariant, which means they can not transform to each other via dissection. In fact the Dehn-Sydler theorem says that they can transform to each other via dissection iff they have the same volume and same Dehn invariant. The generalization for higher dimensions is still open.</li><li><em>An Introduction to Linear Logic</em> by Amélie Comtois. Linear logic is different from classical logic in that if \(A\rightarrow B\) is used then \(A\) is no longer available anymore. She also talked about sequent calculus, which is a formal calculus of logic. Linear logic uses drastically different logical symbols than classical logic as well. Linear logic is an extension of classical logic, and classical logic can be realized in linear logic. Linear logic is thought of as the language of quantum theory. Moreover, I discussed with Amélie about category theory, and I learned from her about multicategories and higher categories. </li><li><em>Exploring Quivers, Representations, and Varieties via Multisegments</em> by Iretomiwa Ajala. This is another talk about quivers, and much more technical than that of Xinrui. Iretomiwa introduced multisegments, and discussed how they related to quivers of type A. He also mentions parabolic induction, which is a method of obtaining a representation of a reductive group from the representations of its parabolic subgroups. </li><li><em>An Introduction to Coxeter Groups and the Properties of their Weak Order</em> by Kimia Shaban. A very interesting talk on the combinatorial side of Coxeter groups. Coxeter groups are a type of groups generated by reflections. She discussed their classification, and the Sperner property of the weak order on Coxeter groups. In the end, she also talked about a conjecture she and her supervisor wish to disprove about the Sperner property of the weak order. </li><li><em>Univariate Tropical Polynomials</em> by Charlotte Lavoie-Bel. Tropical polynomical replace addition with the minimum function and multiplication by the usual addition, which makes it a semifield. Tropical polynomials can be graphed and they will have a cell-looking structure. They can be thought of as the limit of logarithm under base \(0\). They also have a different notion of roots than regular polynomials. We can consider zero locus of tropical polynomials i.e. tropical varieties. The tropical version of some classical algebraic geometry theorems such as Riemann—Roch theorem, can be proven by combinatorial arguments. I like her quote that “tropical geometry is the combinatorial shadow of classical algebraic geometry”.</li></ol><p>There are many other excellent talks that I unfortunately did not attend, and I only wrote about some of the talks I went to. I also gave my own talk on Schubert calculus and cohomology of Grassmannians as the last student speaker of the conference, which you can view in a <a href="/archives/a5b2dbed/">previous post</a>.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

But by then they are sane enough to teach, so a use can still be found for them.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Angus K. Rodgers </p></blockquote><p>For this week, I’ll write about the theory of root systems, especially things related to Weyl groups, weight spaces and etc, for the purpose of my URA. This is because one of the objectives of my URA is to generalise my <a href="/archives/66165fd0/">previous blog post</a> about a fraction of an \(S_n\)-orbit on a hyperplane to Weyl groups. First, a Lie algebra is <em>simple</em> if it is of degree greater than \(1\) (so we are excluding the one dimensional abelian Lie algebras) and has no proper ideals, and a semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. Equivalently, a Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) is semisimple if \(\mathrm{rad}(\mathfrak{g})\), the sum of all solvable ideals (or the maximal solvable ideal), is trivial. Any semisimple Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group \(G\). Let \(\mathrm{ad}:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g})\) by \((\mathrm{ad} X)(Z)=[X,Z]\) be the <em>adjoint representation</em>. Let \(B:\mathfrak{g}\times \mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathbf C\) be the symmetric bilinear form defined by \(B(X,Y)=\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{ad}X\mathrm{ad} Y)\), called the <em>Killing form</em> which is invariant in the sense of \(B([X,Y],Z)=B(X,[Y,Z])\). Cartan’s criterion for semisimplicity says that a Lie algebra is semisimple iff the associated Killing form is nondegenerate. From now on, we let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be a semisimple Lie algebra over \(\mathbf C\). We start by discussing the root–space decomposition \(\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}\oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Phi}\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}\) of semisimple Lie algebras.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Root–space-decomposition"><a href="#Root–space-decomposition" class="headerlink" title="Root–space decomposition"></a>Root–space decomposition</h4><p>Before we begin, we review some terminology. We say that \(\mathfrak{g}\) is abelian if the Lie bracket is identically zero, and a subspace \(\mathfrak{i}\) is an ideal if \([X,Y]\in\mathfrak{i}\) for all \(X\in \mathfrak{g}\) and \(Y\in\mathfrak{i}\). Examples include \(Z(\mathfrak{g})=\{Z\in\mathfrak{g}:[X,Z]=0,\forall X\in\mathfrak{g}\}\) called the center, \(N_{\mathfrak{g}}(k)=\{X\in\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]\in k,\,\forall K\in k\}\) called the normaliser where \(k\) is a subspace of \(\mathfrak g\), and \(C_{\mathfrak g}(k)=\{X\in\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]=0,\,\forall K\in k\}\) called the centraliser where \(k\) is a subset of \(\mathfrak g\). For ideals \(\mathfrak{i},\mathfrak{j}\) of \(\mathfrak{g}\), define \([\mathfrak{i},\mathfrak{j}]\) to be the ideal spanned by \([X,Y]\) where \(X\in \mathfrak{i},Y\in \mathfrak{j}\). We say \(\mathfrak{g}\) is <em>nilpotent</em> if the chain \(\mathfrak{g}\ge [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]\ge [\mathfrak{g},[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]]\ge \cdots\) called the lower central series terminates in zero. We say \(\mathfrak{g}\) is <em>solvable</em> if the chain \(\mathfrak{g}\ge [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]\ge [[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}],[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]]\ge \cdots\) called the derived series terminates in zero. We say \(X\in\mathfrak{g}\) is <em>ad-nilpotent</em> if \(\mathrm{ad}X\) is a nilpotent endomorphism, and semisimple if \(\mathrm{ad}X\) is diagonalisable. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 1. A subalgebra \(\mathfrak{h}\) of \(\mathfrak{g}\) is <em>Cartan</em> if \(\mathfrak h\) satisfies one of the equivalent conditions</p><ol><li>nilpotent and self-normalising (\(N_\mathfrak{g}(\mathfrak h)=\mathfrak h\))</li><li>(if \(\mathfrak g\) is f.d. over field of char. 0) a maximal subalgebra consisting of semisimple elements,</li></ol></blockquote><p>A Cartan subalgebra \(\mathfrak{h}\) is abelian, and combine this with the fact that all elements are semisimple, we have \(\mathrm{ad}[\mathfrak h]\) are simultaneously diagonalisable and there is a direct sum decomposition \(\mathfrak{g}=\bigoplus_{\alpha\in \mathfrak h^*}\mathfrak g_{\alpha}\) where \(\mathfrak{h}^*\) is the dual space and \(\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}=\{X\in\mathfrak g: (\mathrm{ad}H)(X)=\alpha (H)X,\forall H\in\mathfrak h\}\). We have \(\mathfrak g_0=\mathfrak h=C_{\mathfrak g}(\mathfrak h)\). Let \(\Phi=\{\alpha\in \mathfrak{h}^*: \alpha\ne 0, \mathfrak g_{\alpha}\ne 0\}\),<br>\[\mathfrak g=\mathfrak h\oplus\bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Phi}\mathfrak g_{\alpha}\]The elements of \(\Phi\) are called roots, which there are only finitely many. The spaces \(\mathfrak g_{\alpha}\) with \(\alpha\) a root is called the <em>root spaces</em>. It turns out that root spaces all have dimension \(1\).</p><blockquote><p>Example 2. Let \(E_{i,j}\) be the matrix with \(1\) at \((i,j)\) and \(0\) elsewhere. </p><ol><li>Suppose \(\mathfrak g=\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbf C)=\{M\in\mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbf C): \mathrm{tr}(M)=0\}\). We have the Cartan subalgebra \(\mathfrak h\) consists of all diagonal matrices. Let \(e_i\in\mathfrak h^*\) output the \(i\)-th diagonal, then \(\mathrm{ad}(H)E_{i,j}=(e_i(H)-e_j(H))(E_{i,j})\). Thus the roots are \(\alpha_{i,j}=e_{i}-e_{j}\) for \(i\ne j\) and the corresponding root spaces are \(\mathbf CE_{i,j}\).</li><li>Suppose \(\mathfrak g=\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}(\mathbf C)=\{M\in\mathrm{Mat}_{2n+1}(\mathbf C): M^{\mathrm T}=-M\}\). The Cartan subalgebra \(\mathfrak h\) consists of the block diagonal matrices with a \(1\)-by-\(1\) zero block and \(n\) \(2\)-by \(2\) blocks of the form<br>\[\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; ih_j\\ -ih_j &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}\]Let \(e_j\in\mathfrak h^*\) output \(h_j\). The roots are \(\pm e_i\pm e_j\) for \(i\ne j\) and \(e_k\) for \(k\). The root spaces are in Knapp II.1.</li><li>Suppose \(\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\mathbf C)=\{M\in\mathrm{Mat}_{2n}(\mathbf C): M^\mathrm{T}J=-JM\}\) where<br>\[J=\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{0} &amp; I\\ -I&amp; \mathbf{0}\end{bmatrix}\]The Cartan subalgebra \(\mathfrak h\) consists of the diagonal matrices of the form<br>\[\begin{bmatrix}H &amp; \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{0} &amp; -H\end{bmatrix}\]where \(H\in\mathrm{Mat}_n(\mathbf C)\) is diagonal. Let \(e_j\in\mathfrak{h}^*\) output the the \(j\)-th diagonal of \(H\) in the above matrix. The roots are \(\pm e_i\pm e_j\) for \(i\ne j\) and \(\pm 2e_k\) for \(k\). The root spaces are in Knapp II.1.</li><li>Suppose \(\mathfrak g=\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\mathbf C)=\{M\in\mathrm{Mat}_{2n}(\mathbf C): M^{\mathrm T}=-M\}\). The Cartan subalgebra is similar to that of \(\mathfrak g=\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\mathbf C)\) except the last zero block. The roots are \(\pm e_i\pm e_j\) with \(i\ne j\).</li></ol></blockquote><p>Note that we have \([\mathfrak g_{\alpha},\mathfrak{g}_{\beta}]\subseteq \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha+\beta}\), and if \(\alpha,\beta\in\Phi\) and \(\alpha\ne -\beta\) then \(B(\mathfrak g_{\alpha},\mathfrak g_{\beta})=0\). Also, we note that \(\Phi\) spans \(\mathfrak h^*\). In the next section, we define abstract root systems and formalize how we could obtain the Weyl group from \(\Phi\). There is a different way we could define Weyl groups using <a href="https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Maximal_torus">maximal torus</a>.</p><h4 id="Root-systems"><a href="#Root-systems" class="headerlink" title="Root systems"></a>Root systems</h4><p>A root system is a configuration of vectors in the euclidean space that satisfies some geometric properties, which helps us with some classification problems in representation theory of Lie algebras. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A <em>root system</em> is a Euclidean space \(E\) and a finite set of nonzero vectors \(\Phi\subseteq E\) such that </p><ol><li>\(\mathrm{Span}(\Phi)=E\),</li><li>for \(\alpha\in\Phi\), the only scalar multiples of \(\alpha\) in \(\Phi\) are \(\pm \alpha\),</li><li>for any \(\alpha,\beta\in\Phi\), we have \(\langle\beta,\alpha \rangle=2\frac{(\alpha,\beta)}{(\alpha,\alpha)}\in\mathbf Z\) is an integer,</li><li>for \(\alpha\in\Phi\), we have the reflection of any \(\beta\in\Phi\) about the hyperplane perpendicular to \(\alpha\), i.e. \[\sigma_{\alpha}(\beta)=\beta-\langle \beta,\alpha\rangle \alpha=\beta-2\frac{(\alpha,\beta)}{(\alpha,\alpha)}\alpha\]is still in \(\Phi\).</li></ol><p>where \((\cdot,\cdot)\) is the standard inner product. The elements of \(\Phi\) are <em>roots</em>. The rank of \(\Phi\) is the dimension of \(E\). A morphism of root systems is a linear morphism between the Euclidean spaces which preserves \(\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle\). A root system \(\Phi\) is <em>reducible</em> if \(\Phi=\Phi_1\cup\Phi_2\) s.t. \((\alpha,\beta)=0\) for all \(\alpha\in\Phi_1\) and \(\beta\in\Phi_2\).</p></blockquote><p>We can draw diagrams of root systems, for example, the following is an example of a root system called \(G_2\). This is in fact an irreducible root system. It does not decompose into disjoint unions that are orthogonal to each other.</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/Root_system_G2.svg" alt="The root system G2" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"></p><p>I credit this picture to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Root_system_G2.svg">this page</a> of the wikipedia media repository. Here’s another picture of the root system \(C_3\) (arising from the sympletic Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{sp}_{6}\)) drawn by my friend Maya, and a physical model we made together using coffee stirrers (it may not be the most accurate model but it’s hard work). </p><p align="center"><img src="/images/IMG_5337.JPG" alt="The root system C3" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"><img src="/images/IMG_5342.JPG" alt="Physical model of the root system C3" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"></p><p>The <em>Weyl</em> group of a root system \(\Phi\) is the group of all reflections \(W(\Phi)=\{\sigma_{\alpha}:\alpha\in\Phi\}\le \mathrm{GL}(E)\). This is a <em>Coxeter group</em>, i.e. a group with a presentation of the form \(\langle r_1,\dots,r_n\mid (r_ir_j)^{m_{i,j}}\rangle\) where \(m_{i,i}=1\) and \(m_{i,j}&gt;1\) for \(i\ne j\) where \(m_{i,j}=\infty\) when there are no relation. The Weyl group acts faithfully on the roots. For a Lie algebra \(\mathfrak g\) with root space decomposition \(\mathfrak h\oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Phi}\mathfrak g_{\alpha}\), the set \(\Phi\) is a root system. The Weyl chambers of a root system is the set of connected components of the complement of the union of all hyperplanes perpendicular to a root. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 4. A <em>base</em> for the root system is a subset \(\Delta\subseteq\Phi\), whose elements are called <em>simple roots</em>, such that \(\Delta\) is a basis for \(E\), and each root is a linear combination of \(\Delta\) with integer coefficients such that the coefficients are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive, which are called the positive and negative roots with respect to \(\Delta\). The <em>height</em> of a root with respect to \(\Delta\) is the sum of all its coefficients in the basis \(\Delta\).</p></blockquote><p>Equivalently, we can take a hyperplane not containing any root and define the positive roots as a fixed side, where the simple roots are the positive roots that cannot be written as the sum of two positive roots. The simple roots generate the Weyl group. The <em>fundamental Weyl chamber</em> associated to a base \(\Delta\) is the set of points \(\{v\in E:(\alpha,v)&gt;0,\forall \alpha\in \Delta\}\). For each root \(\alpha\), define the coroot \(\alpha^{\lor}=\frac{2}{\langle \alpha,\alpha\rangle}\alpha\), the set of coroots forms the dual of the root system \(\Phi^\lor\).</p><h4 id="Classification-of-root-systems"><a href="#Classification-of-root-systems" class="headerlink" title="Classification of root systems"></a>Classification of root systems</h4><p>For \(\alpha,\beta\in\Phi\), since \(\cos(\theta_{\alpha,\beta})=\frac{(\alpha,\beta)^2}{(\alpha,\alpha)(\beta,\beta)}\), we have \(\langle \alpha,\beta\rangle\langle \beta,\alpha\rangle=4\cos^2(\theta_{\alpha,\beta})\le 4\) which is an integer by assumption. Thus, we can list all the possibilities for the angles and for \(\langle \alpha,\beta\rangle\)</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/table.png" alt="Table of angles of roots" style="height: 181px; width: 322px;"></p><p>If \(\Delta\) is a base for \(\Phi\), then the Cartan matrix associated to \(\Delta\) is \(C=(\langle\alpha_i,\alpha_j \rangle)\in\mathrm{Mat}_{\ell}(\mathbf Z)\) where \(\Delta=\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_{\ell}\}\) where \(\ell=|\Delta|\). Changing the order of roots just permutes the Cartan matrix’s rows and columns. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 5. The <em>Dynkin diagram</em> of a root system \(\Phi\) with respect to a base \(\Delta\) is a graph with undirected or directed edges with possibly multiple edges, such that the vertices are \(\Delta\) and the number of edges between \(\alpha,\beta\in\Delta\) is \(\max(|\langle\alpha,\beta \rangle|,|\langle \beta,\alpha\rangle |)\), directed towards the longer root if the number of edges is more than one.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously the root system is irreducible iff the Dynkin diagram is connected. Two root systems are isomorphic iff they have the same Dynkin diagram. A classification of all Dynkin diagrams can be found <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~julia/teaching/581C_Fall2010/Snow_Lecture.pdf">here</a>. The bases for the root systems according to these classification can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_system#Explicit_construction_of_the_irreducible_root_systems">here</a>. The simply laced (no multiple edges) Dynkin diagrams shows up in classification problems in many different areas in mathematics: labelled graphs, quivers, 2d conformal field theories, etc. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_classification">ADE classification</a>.</p><p>The Dynkin diagram also tells us information about the presentation of the Weyl group. For two distinct simple roots \(s,r\in\Delta\), the order \(m\) of \(sr\) in the presentation of the Weyl group is determined by the number of edges between their corresponding vertices in the Dynkin diagram. If there are no edges then \(m=2\), if there is one edge then \(m=3\), if there are two edges then \(m=4\), and if there are three edges then \(m=6\).</p><h4 id="Bruhat-order-on-Coxeter-groups"><a href="#Bruhat-order-on-Coxeter-groups" class="headerlink" title="Bruhat order on Coxeter groups"></a>Bruhat order on Coxeter groups</h4><p>An important step in Pawlowski’s paper was bounding \(\mathcal O(v,w)\) using the antichains in the Bruhat order. The Bruhat order can in fact be defined over any Coxeter group.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 6. If \(W\) is a Coxeter group with standard generators \(S\), the <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(W\) is defined by \(u\le v\) iff some substring of a \(S\)-reduced word for \(v\) is a \(S\)-reduced word for \(u\).</p></blockquote><p>As an example, we calculate the Weyl group of the root system arising from \(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}\) and its Bruhat order. From Example 2.3 earlier, we have \(\Phi=\{\pm e_i\pm e_j:i\ne j\}\cup\{\pm 2e_k:k\}\). To compute the presentation, we first choose a set of simple roots \(\Delta=\{2e_1,e_2-e_1,e_3-e_2,\dots,e_{n}-e_{n-1}\}\), and by computing the Cartan matrix, we derive the following Dynkin diagram which then determines the Weyl group \(W(\Phi)\).</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/IMG_5343.JPG" alt="Weyl group and Dynkin diagram of Sp(2n)" style="height: 390px; width: 610px;"></p><p>Next, we find the reduced words in the group. For a word in this group, if two neighboring letters differ by an index greater than \(1\) then we cannot reduce the two letters further, and if they do not differ then they reduce to \(1\). Thus the reduced words are the concatonation of proper substrings of \((s_1s_2)^4\) and \((s_ks_{k+1})^3\) for \(k\ge 2\) such that each neighboring pair of such block do not form the string \((s_1s_2)^4\) or \((s_ks_{k+1})^3\) for \(k\ge 2\) and such that the two neighboring ends are not the same letter. For example, the word \(s_3s_4s_3s_4s_5s_4s_5s_7s_6\) is reduced. Observe that the reduced words are unique. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \(\sigma\in S_n\) acts on \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) by permutation, and let \(\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\{\sigma\in S_n: w\cdot \sigma v=0\}\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \(\sum_ix_i=0\), where \(n\ge 3\). In notations, we have the following theorem.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Theorem 1. For \(n\ge 3\), we have<br>\[\max\{|\mathcal{O}(v,w)|: v\in S,w\in\mathbf{R}^n\}=2\lfloor n/2\rfloor (n-2)!\]where \(S=\{v\in \mathbf R^n: v\cdot \mathbf{1}\ne 0, v\mathrm{\ has\ distinct\ coordinates}\}\).</p></blockquote><p>An explicit construction that achieves this bound is given by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, so it suffice to show that this is the best bound. The proof uses Bruhat order and Sperner property. </p><h4 id="Bruhat-order"><a href="#Bruhat-order" class="headerlink" title="Bruhat order"></a>Bruhat order</h4><p>Suppose \(\alpha\vdash n\) with \(\ell(\alpha)=m\), and \(i_j=\sum_{k=1}^j\alpha_j\) for \(j=0,1\dots,m\). Let \(X_{\alpha}\) be the set of ordered set partitions of type \(\alpha\). Naturally, we have \(\alpha^*\in X_{\alpha}\) where \(\alpha^*_j=\{i_j+1,i_j+2,\dots,i_{j+1}\}\). Let \(S(\alpha)=\{i_1,\dots,i_{m-1}\}\). We have \(S_n\) acts on \(X_{\alpha}\) by element, which is a transitive action. Thus identify \(X_{\alpha}\cong S_n/S_\alpha\) where \(S_{\alpha}\) is the stabilizer of \(\alpha^*\). Denote \(\alpha!=|S_{\alpha}|=\prod_{i}\alpha_i!\)</p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. The <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(S_n/S_\alpha\) is the transitive closure (they are connected by relations of the following kind) of \(B&lt;(i\ j)B\) for \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\) where \(i\in B_a\) and \(j\in B_b\) and \(a&lt;b\) and \(i&lt;j\).</p></blockquote><p>We note that the <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(S_n/S_{(1,\dots,1)}\) is just the usual Bruhat order on \(S_n\). For \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\) let \(\operatorname{word}(B)\) be the permutation by concatonating the numbers in each set written in their usual order. This sends ordered set partitions to a more common definition: \(\sigma\in S_n\) where \(\sigma(i)&gt;\sigma(i+1)\) implies \(i\in S(\alpha)\), and Bruhat order restricted to such permutations. There is an obvious bijection \((S_n/S_\alpha)\times S_\alpha\rightarrow S_n\) by \((B,\sigma)\mapsto \operatorname{word}(B)\sigma\). The \(\alpha\)-Bruhat order \(\le_{\alpha}\) on \(S_n\) is the image of \((B,\sigma)\le (B^\prime,\sigma^\prime)\) iff \(\sigma=\sigma^\prime\) and \(B\le B^\prime\) in Bruhat order under the aforementioned bijection, which is isomorphic to \(\alpha!\) isomorphic copies of \(S_n/S_\alpha\). If \(w\in\mathbf R^n\), define \(\operatorname{comp}(w)\vdash n\) as the composition of lengths of the weekly increasing components. An antichain in a poset is a set consisting of elements from different disjoint components.</p><blockquote><p>Lemma 3. Suppose \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) is stricly increasing and \(w\in\mathbf R^n\) weakly increasing, then \(\mathcal O(v,w)\) is an antichain in the \(\alpha\)-Bruhat order where \(\alpha=\operatorname{comp}(w)\).</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Suppose \(\pi\in S_{\alpha}\) and \(\tau=\operatorname{word}(B)\) for some \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\).

&lt;p&gt;This week is the first week of the spring term and also my first week of undergraduate research with Prof. Satriano, so I decided to write about a research paper I’ve given to read, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08535.pdf&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \(\sigma\in S_n\) acts on \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) by permutation, and let \(\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\{\sigma\in S_n: w\cdot \sigma v=0\}\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \(\sum_ix_i=0\), where \(n\ge 3\). In notations, we have the following theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

This will help us to build our way to the definition of a stack. The idea of faifully flat descent is that a certain property of schemes can be descended via a cartesian square with a fppf side. The important result we are building towards is that for any scheme \(X\), the functor of points \(\mathscr{H}_X\) is a sheaf on the fppf site of \(X\). After this, we can talk about fibred categories. Fibred categories plus descents is categorical stacks, plus geometry is algebraic stacks.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Fppf-site-and-faithfully-flat-descent"><a href="#Fppf-site-and-faithfully-flat-descent" class="headerlink" title="Fppf site and faithfully flat descent"></a>Fppf site and faithfully flat descent</h4><p>We recall that a map of schemes is fppf iff it is faithfully flat (i.e. flat and surjective) and locally of finite presentation, and recall that the fppf site \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\) consists of the fppf covers, i.e. the jointly surjective, flat and locally of finite presentation families of morphisms. We have the following problem.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 1.

Another important result is faithfully flat descent. The idea is, if \(P\) is some property of morphism of schemes, given morphisms of schemes \(f_1:X_1\rightarrow Y_1\) and \(f_2:X_2\rightarrow Y_2\) and suppose there is a commutative diagram <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJYXzEiXSxbMSwwLCJZXzEiXSxbMCwxLCJYXzIiXSxbMSwxLCJZXzIiXSxbMCwxLCJmXzEiXSxbMiwzLCJmXzIiXSxbMCwyLCJcXG1hdGhybXtmcHBmfSIsMix7InN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6ImVwaSJ9fX1dLFsxLDNdXQ==&embed" width="184" height="184" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important; border: none;border-radius: 0px;"></iframe></div> </p><p>then frequently \(f_1\) has property \(P\) iff \(f_2\) does. We say that \(P\) is local on the base (target) for the fppf topology (et al. Zariski, etc.) if \(f_1\) has property \(P\) implies \(f_2\) does. Examples of properties that are local on the base for the fppf topology inlcude: surjective, locally of finite type, locally of finite presentation, universally closed/open, separated, proper, etc. The full proof can be found on <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02YJ">stacks project</a>.</p><h4 id="Fibred-categories"><a href="#Fibred-categories" class="headerlink" title="Fibred categories"></a>Fibred categories</h4><p>For a category \(\mathcal C\), a category over \(\mathcal C\) is some category \(\mathcal F\) equipped with a functor \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal C\).

This diagram is sometimes known as the “universal property” of cartesian morphisms. Note that given two pullbacks \(\phi_1:\xi_1\rightarrow\eta\) and \(\phi_2:\xi_2\rightarrow\eta\) then substitute \(\psi=\xi_i\) for \(i=1,2\) will give us an isomorphism \(\xi_1\cong\xi_2\). Thus, pullbacks are unique up to a unique isomorphism. Note that in SGA1 the definition of cartesian arrow is different and this definition is sometimes known as strongly cartesian. Next, we introduce the following properties, which is easy to check,</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 2. Let \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal C\) be a category over the category \(\mathcal C\).</p><ol><li>composite of cartesian arrows are cartesian,</li><li>if \(\psi:\eta\rightarrow \zeta\) and \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) are arrows in \(\mathcal F\) with \(\psi\) cartesian, then \(\phi\) is cartesian iff \(\psi\circ\phi\) is,</li><li>if \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) is an arrow and \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi\) is an isomorphism, then \(\phi\) is cartesian iff it is an isomorphism,</li></ol></blockquote><p>With these knowledge, we can introduce fibred categories. Fibred categories are used to provide a general framework for descent theory. They formalize various situations in geometry and algebra where pullbacks of objects are defined. A motivating example is the category of vector bundles on a topological space.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. </p><ol><li>A <em>fibred category</em> over a category \(\mathcal C\) is a category \(\mathcal F\) over \(\mathcal C\) such that for each \(f:U\rightarrow V\) in \(\mathcal C\) where \(V=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\eta)\) for some \(\eta\in \mathcal F\), there exists \(\xi\in\mathcal F\) with \(U=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)\) and cartesian arrow \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) such that \(f=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi\).</li><li>Suppose \(\mathcal F,\mathcal G\) are fibred categories over \(\mathcal C\), then a <em>morphism of fibred categories</em> \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow \mathcal G\) is a functor such that \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal G}\circ \mathscr{F}=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\) and \(\mathscr{F}\) sends cartesian arrows to cartesian arrows. </li><li>Suppose \(\mathcal F\) is a category over \(\mathcal C\) and \(U\in\mathcal C\), write \(\mathcal F(U)\) as the subcategory of \(\mathcal F\) whose objects are \(\xi\in\mathcal F\) such that \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)=U\) and morphisms are \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow \eta\) where \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi=\mathbf{1}_U\).</li><li>If \(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{G}:\mathcal F\rightarrow \mathcal G\) are morphisms of fibred categories, a <em>base-preserving natural transformation</em> \(\alpha:\mathscr{F}\rightarrow \mathscr{G}\) is a natural transformation such that for all \(u\in\mathcal F\) we have \(\alpha(u):\mathscr{F}(u)\rightarrow \mathscr{G}(u)\) is such that \(\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u))=\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{G}(u))\) and \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal G}\alpha(u)=\mathbf 1_{\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u))}\), i.e. \(\alpha(u)\) is a morphism in \(\mathcal G(\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u)))\). </li><li>Denote by \(\mathrm{MOR}_{\mathcal C}(\mathcal F,\mathcal G)\) the category whose objects are morphisms of fibred categories and morphisms are base-preserving natural transformations.</li><li>For a morphism of fibred categories \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal G\) over \(\mathcal C\) and \(U\in\mathcal C\), we write \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) to denote the functor where \(\mathscr{F}_U(\xi)=\mathscr{F}(\xi)\) and \(\mathscr{F}_U\phi=\mathscr{F}\phi\).</li></ol></blockquote><p>Thus in a fibred category we can pullback objects along any arrow. For example, for a category \(\mathcal C\) with \(X\in\mathcal C\), we have \(\mathcal C/X\) is fibred over \(\mathcal C\) via \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal C/X}:\mathcal C/X\rightarrow \mathcal C\) given by \((Y\rightarrow X)\mapsto Y\) and morphisms are mapped to themsleves. It should be easy to check that this is well-defined.</p><p>Why do we need fibred categories? Suppose \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) is a morphism of schemes. For any morphism of schemes \(t:T\rightarrow Y\) we can form a fibred product \(T\times_Y X\) which is only unique up to a unique isomorphism. Thus implicitly there is a choice being made. This becomes a technical obstacle in developing the theory of stacks, and fibred categories are used to address this problem. For more detail, see Example 3.1.5 in Olsson’s book. </p><p>The collection of categories fibred over a fixed category is an example of a \(2\)-category. Roughly speaking, a \(2\)-category is a category where the morphisms between two objects form a category. However, we will not use higher categorical language. </p><blockquote><p>Lemma 4. Let \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal G\) be a morphism of fibred categories over \(\mathcal C\), </p><ol><li>\(\mathscr{F}\) is fully faithful (as a functor) iff \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) is fully faithful for all \(U\in\mathcal C\),</li><li>\(\mathscr{F}\) is an equivalence (of categories) iff \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) is an equivalence for all \(U\in\mathcal C\).</li></ol><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Lemma 3.1.8, Olsson.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>Recall the classical Yoneda lemma: for each object \(A\in\mathcal C\) we have a natural isomorphism between the collection of natural transformations \(\mathrm{Nat}(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{H}^A)\), and the set \(\mathscr{F}(A)\). This point of view is crucial for the development of algebraic spaces, and also for fibred categories we need a variant of this lemma.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 5 (\(2\)-Yoneda lemma). Suppose \(\mathcal F\) is fibred over \(\mathcal C\), there is an equivalence<br>\[\mathrm{MOR}_{\mathcal C}(\mathcal C/X,\mathcal F)\cong \mathcal F(X)\]given by \(\mathscr{F}\mapsto \mathscr{F}(\mathbf 1_{X})\).</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Proposition 3.2.2 Olsson.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>It is often useful to think of a fibred category as the collection of categories \(\mathcal{F}(U)\) with a pullback functor. Thus, we introduce split fibred categories. We will not go over the details of the rigorous definition, but the reader can check 3.3.1 in Olsson’s book.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

After this, we can talk about fibred categories. Fibred categories plus descents is categorical stacks, plus geometry is algebraic stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

In the end of this semaster hopefully I will have written enough about them in this blog so that I can compile them into actual typesetted notes. We start by revisiting étale morphisms and introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Then, we will define important sites such as the big and small Zariski sites and étale sites as well as the fppf site. </p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Etale-morphisms-of-schemes"><a href="#Etale-morphisms-of-schemes" class="headerlink" title="Étale morphisms of schemes"></a>Étale morphisms of schemes</h4><p>First, we revisit the definitions and properties of étale morphisms of schemes. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A morphism of schemes \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) is <em>étale</em> if one of these equivalent conditions holds</p><ol><li>\(f\) is smooth and locally quasi-finite,</li><li>\(f\) is smooth and unramified,</li><li>\(f\) is flat and unramified,</li><li>\(f\) is locally of finite presentation and formally étale</li><li>\(f\) is locally of finite presentation and locally a standard étale morphism,</li></ol></blockquote><p>There are many more equivalent definitions of étale morphisms listed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tale_morphism">wikipedia</a>. Intuitively, I think of étale morphisms analogous to covering maps. We need this notion to define the étale topology which we will need to use later. As a side note, there is also something called the étale fundamental group, which also uses the notion of étale morphisms. We recall these properties of étale morphisms.</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 4. </p><ol><li>compotision of étale maps are étale,</li><li>if \(f:Y\rightarrow X\) is étale then its base change \(Y\times_XZ\rightarrow Z\) is étale,</li><li>if \(f:Y\rightarrow X\) and \(g:Z\rightarrow X\) are étale and \(g=f\circ h\) where \(h:Z\rightarrow Y\), then \(h\) is étale</li><li>given algebraically closed field \(k\) and \(k\)-algebra \(A\), then the morphism \(\mathrm{Spec}(A)\rightarrow\mathrm{Spec}(k)\) is étale iff it is the disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of \(k\).</li></ol></blockquote><p>Now, we are ready to define Grothendieck topology and sites.</p><h4 id="Grothendieck-topology-sites-and-topoi"><a href="#Grothendieck-topology-sites-and-topoi" class="headerlink" title="Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi"></a>Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi</h4><p>Recall that a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space \(X\) is a contravariant functor \(\mathscr{F}:\mathrm{Op}(X)\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}\), and a presheaf is a sheaf when \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\cap U_j)\) is an equalizer for every open cover \(\{U_{i}\}\) of any open \(U\subseteq X\), which is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms. We want to extend this from \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) to any category \(\mathcal C\). To do this, we need to add some additional structure on the category \(\mathcal C\) so that its objects can be viewed as “open sets” and morphisms can be viewed as “inclusions”. Grothendieck’s insight is that we don’t need the full strength of a topology to define sheaves, we only need intersections and a notion of when a collection of an open set forms an open cover of it. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 1. A <em>Grothendieck topology</em> on a category \(\mathcal C\) is the data of a set of <em>coverings</em> of \(U\), written as \(\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), for each object \(U\in \mathcal C\), where each covering \(S\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) is a set of morphisms of \(\mathcal C\) with \(U\) as targets, such that for all \(U\in\mathcal C\)</p><ol><li>for each isomorphism \(\varphi:V\rightarrow U\), we have \(\{\varphi\}\in \mathrm{Cov}(U)\)</li><li>if \(\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) and \(\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow V_i\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(V_i)\) for each \(i\), then \(\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\)</li><li>for \(\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) and \(W\rightarrow U\), all \(W\times_UV_i\) exists and \(\{W\times_UV_i\rightarrow W\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(W)\)</li></ol><p>A category \(\mathcal C\) equipped with a choice of Grothendieck topology, also denoted \(\mathcal C\), is a <em>site</em>. A continuous functor between sites \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal D\) is a functor between their underlying categories such that for all \(\{X_i\rightarrow X\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal C}(X)\) we have \(\{f(X_i)\rightarrow f(X)\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal D}(f(X))\), and it commutes with finite fibred products if they exist.</p></blockquote><p>For example, \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) for a topological space \(X\) can be made into a site using the usual notion of covering. We note that in \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) we have the fibered product \(U\times_X V=U\cap V\) for all open \(U,V\subseteq X\), which agrees with the usual notion of intersection. For a category \(\mathcal C\) with \(X\in\mathcal C\), the category of objects over \(X\), denoted \(\mathcal C/X\) is the category where objects are morphisms \(Y\rightarrow X\) in \(\mathcal C\) and morphisms between \(Y_1\rightarrow X\) and \(Y_2\rightarrow X\) are all morphisms \(Y_1\rightarrow Y_2\) in \(\mathcal C\) such that the obvious triangle commutes, i.e. \((Y_1\rightarrow Y_2\rightarrow X)=Y_1\rightarrow X\). If \(\mathcal C\) is a site, then \(\mathcal C/X\) can be given a site structure, by letting \(\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)\) in \(\mathcal C/X\) be \(\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) in \(\mathcal C\). The site \(\mathcal C/X\) is called the <em>localization</em> of the site \(\mathcal C\) at \(X\). Suppose \(X\) is a scheme, then we say that the <em>big Zariski (resp. big étale, resp. fppf) site</em>, denoted \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{Zar}}\) (resp. \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{ét}}\), resp. \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\)) of \(X\), is the site with the category \(\mathbf{Sch}/X\) and \(\{Y_i\rightarrow Y\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) iff each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is an open immersion with \(Y=\bigcup_i Y_i\) (resp. each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is étale with \(\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y\) surjective, resp. each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is flat and locally of finite presentation with \(\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y\) surjective). An element of \(\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)\) is called a <em>Zariski cover</em> (resp. <em>étale cover</em>, resp. <em>fppf cover</em>) of \(U\). The small Zariski site (resp. small étale site) of \(X\), denoted \(X_{\mathrm{Zar}}\) (resp. \(X_{\mathrm{ét}}\)) is the site whose category is the full subcategory of \(\mathrm{Sch}/X\) where each object \(U\rightarrow X\) is an open immersion (resp. étale), and the coverings are the same as the big Zariski (resp. big étale) site. The small Zariski site of \(X\) is equivalent to the site \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\). Moreover, we have the following inclusions<br>\[\{\mathrm{Zariski\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{étale\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{fppf\ cover}\}\]Next, we discuss presheaves and sheaves on a site. This whole business is to get new cohomology theories such as étale cohomology, because basic sheaf cohomology is insufficient for our needs.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. A <em>presheaf</em> (of sets) on a site \(\mathcal C\) is a contravariant functor \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}\), and a presheaf is a <em>sheaf</em> iff \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\times_U U_j)\) is an equalizer for all \(U\in\mathcal C\) and \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\). A presheaf is called <em>separated</em> if for all \(U\in\mathcal C\) and \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), the map \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)\) is injective. We write \(\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) (resp. \(\mathrm{PSh}(\mathcal C)\)) for the category of sheaves (resp. presheaves) of the site \(\mathcal C\).</p></blockquote><p>Note that a separated presheaf can be viewed as a presheaf that only satisfies one of the axioms of a sheaf, the identity axiom, but not necessaily the gluability axiom, therefore we have the obvious inclusions<br>\[\{\mathrm{sheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{separated\ presheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{presheaves}\}\]all of which admits left adjoints, the composition of them being sheafification. Usually, we can formulate sheafification in terms of compatible germs, but since we are working over sites, it does not make sense to take a point in an object and take the product of stalks. The way we construct the adjoint from presheaves to separated presheaves is to map a presheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) to \(\mathscr{F}^{\mathrm s}(U)=\mathscr{F}(U)/\sim\) where \(a\sim b\) iff exists \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) such that \(a,b\) are mapped to the same element by the map \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)\). We can check that this is in fact a separated presheaf. All of the above works for (pre)sheaves of rings, abelian groups, etc.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A <em>topos</em> is a category equivalent to \(\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) for a site \(\mathcal C\). A morphism of topoi \(f:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2\) is an adjoint pair \(f^*\dashv f_*\) of functors \(f^*:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2\) and \(f_*:\mathcal{T}_2\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_1\) with a choice of natural isomorphism<br>\[\Phi:\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_1}(f^*(-),-)\rightarrow \mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_2}(-,f_*(-))\]where each naturality here means \(\Phi\) is natural in each of the two dashes, and \(f^*\) commutes with finite limits when they exist. Define composition in the obvious way.</p></blockquote><p>We remark that in the above definition, commuting with finite limits is equivalent to checking that \(f^*\) commutes with finite products and preserve equalizers. In many cases, though not always, a continuous functor between sites \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D\) induces a functor \(f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) by \(f_*(\mathscr{F})(X)=\mathscr{F}(f(X))\), where the well-definedness follows from \(\mathscr{F}(f(U_i\times_U U_j))=\mathscr{F}(f(U_i)\times_{f(U)} f(U_j))\) for any \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), as illustrated by the diagram <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNixbMCwxLCJcXG1hdGhzY3J7Rn0oZihVKSkiXSxbMSwxLCJcXHByb2RfaVxcbWF0aHNjcntGfShmKFVfaSkpIl0sWzIsMSwiXFxwcm9kX3tpLGp9XFxtYXRoc2Nye0Z9KGYoVV9pKVxcdGltZXNfe2YoVSl9ZihVX2opKSJdLFswLDAsImZfKihcXG1hdGhzY3J7Rn0pKFUpIl0sWzEsMCwiXFxwcm9kX2lmXyooXFxtYXRoc2Nye0Z9KShVX2kpIl0sWzIsMCwiXFxwcm9kX3tpLGp9Zl8qKFxcbWF0aHNjcntGfSkoVV9pXFx0aW1lc19VIFVfaikiXSxbMCwxXSxbMSwyLCIiLDAseyJvZmZzZXQiOjF9XSxbMyw0XSxbMywwLCJcXGNvbmciXSxbNCwxLCJcXGNvbmciXSxbNSwyLCJcXGNvbmciXSxbNCw1LCIiLDAseyJvZmZzZXQiOi0xfV0sWzQsNSwiIiwwLHsib2Zmc2V0IjoxfV0sWzEsMiwiIiwwLHsib2Zmc2V0IjotMX1dXQ==&embed" width="545" height="182" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important;"></iframe></div><br>This induced functor does not always admit a left adjoint. However, we have the following theorem</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 4. If \(\mathcal C,\mathcal D\) are sites with small underlying categories, then the functor \(f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) induced by a continuous functor \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D\) admits a left adjoint \(f^*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\). If, further, that finite limits in \(\mathcal C\) are representable and \(f\) commutes with them, then \(f^*\) commutes with finite limits. </p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>We construct this functor concretely. For each \(U\in\mathcal D\), let \(\mathcal I_U\) be the category where objects are pairs \(\langle V,\rho\rangle\) where \(V\in\mathcal C\) and \(\rho\in \mathrm{Mor}_\mathcal{D}(U,f(V))\), and a morphism \(g:\langle V_1,\rho_1\rangle \rightarrow \langle V_2,\rho_2\rangle\) is a morphism \(g:V_1\rightarrow V_2\) in \(\mathcal C\) such that \((fg)\circ\rho_1=\rho_2\). We define\[f^*(\mathscr{F})(U)=\lim_{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\langle V,\rho\rangle\in\mathcal I_{U}^\mathrm{op}}}\mathscr{F}(V)\]and for each \(h:U_1\rightarrow U_2\) in \(\mathcal C\), there is functor \(\mathcal I_{U_2}\rightarrow \mathcal I_{U_1}\) given by \(\langle V,\rho\rangle\mapsto \langle V,\rho\circ h\rangle\) which induces a morphism \(f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_2)\rightarrow f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_1)\).

My project is called “Galois cohomology and weak Mordell–Weil theorem”, which is available <a href="/documents/Galois_Cohomology.pdf">here</a>. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \(k\) with an algebraic closure \(K\), the Galois group \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit of topological Galois groups \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \(L/k\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \(G\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \(G\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology  where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \(G\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation. </p><span id="more"></span><p>My final project focuses on the proof of the weak Mordell–Weil theorem, which states that for any elliptic curve \(E\), the group \(E(k)/nE(k)\) is finite for all \(n\ge 2\). This is an important step in the proof of the Mordell–Weil theorem which states the elliptic curve groups are finitely generated. The proof of Mordell–Weil involves in applying an infinite descent argument to weak Mordell–Weil, which I will not go into detail. The motivating observation is that we have an exact sequence of topological \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\)-modules \[\mathbf{0}\rightarrow E(K)[n]\rightarrow E(K)\xrightarrow{n}E(K)\rightarrow\mathbf{0}\]This short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which we truncate after the first cohomology groups. The first cohomology group can be viewed as the group of crossed homomorphisms module the principal crossed homomorphisms, where a crossed homomorphism is some \(f\) with \(f(gh)=gf(h)+f(g)\) for all \(g,h\) and a principal crossed homomorphism is a homomorphism where there exists \(m\) with \(f(g)=gm-m\) for all \(g\). This can be verified by just computing out the differential. Next, we define the \(n\)-Selmer groups and the Tate-Shafarevich group, which is applied to the induced exact sequence we just found in order to obtain a better bound for the group \(E(k)/nE(k)\). Finally, the finiteness of \(E(k)/nE(k)\) is obtained from the finiteness of the Selmer groups.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>
