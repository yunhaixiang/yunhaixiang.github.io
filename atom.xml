In one respect this last point is accurate.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> David Mumford </p></blockquote><p>Continuing last week, we are finally going to define the derived category \(D(\mathcal A)\) for an abelian category \(\mathcal A\). Before we actually do that, we need to introduce localization of categories, and we will define the derived category in terms of a localization of the homotopy category of complexes. Localization of categories is very analogous to localization of rings or modules. Given any category (with no assumption of abelian, additive, triangulated, etc), we formally invert a class of morphisms. We will give one definition in terms of a localization construction and show that it is unsatisfactory in that it does not have a lot of useful and desirable properties. We will then develop a better description of derived categories in terms of roofs.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition 1. Let \(\mathcal A\) be a category and \(S\) a class of morphisms of it, then define its localization as a category \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) and a functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow A[S^{-1}]\) s.t. \(Q(s)\) is an isomorphism for all \(s\in S\) and \(Q\) is universal w.r.t. this property, i.e. if the functor \(F:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is such that \(F(s)\) is an isomorphism for each \(s\), then there exists a unique functor \(G:\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\rightarrow\mathcal B\) s.t. \(F=G\circ Q\). </p></blockquote><p>The way we obtain a construction that satisfies this universal property is quite convoluted. We define it this way. Let \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) have the same objects as \(\mathcal A\). For each \(X,Y\in\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\), let a directed edge between them be a morphism \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\) or if \(s\in S\cap \mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\), an edge in the opposite direction \(s:Y\rightarrow X\). A path between two objects \(M,N\in A[S^{-1}]\) is a sequence of directed edges \(M=L_0, L_1,\dots,L_n=N\), where the direction does not need to be the same. We define \(\mathrm{Hom}(M,N)\) as the equivalence class of paths where two paths are equivalent if they can be transformed to each other via a sequence of the following transformations.</p><ol><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{f}Y\xrightarrow{g}Z\), replace with \(X\xrightarrow{gf}Z\),</li><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{s} Y\xleftarrow{s}X\) where \(s\in S\), replace with \(X\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_X} X\),</li><li>for \(Y\xleftarrow{s} X\xrightarrow{s}Y\) where \(s\in S\), replace with \(Y\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_Y} Y\),</li><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_X}X\xleftarrow{s} Y\), replace with \(X\xleftarrow{s}Y\)</li></ol><p>Long story short, this is a well defined equivalence relation, so it forms a category where composition is concatonation. For the localization functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A[S^{-1}]\), it sends objects to themselves, and morphisms to the equivalence class with the path being the single morphism. Here we should give extra care that the arrows can some times mean directed edges, and is \(Y\leftarrow X\) can mean a path from \(Y\) to \(X\), only with the directed edge in the opposite direction. We can verify that this indeed satisfies the universal property of localization. We may also check that by this localization construciton, one can write morphisms in the form \[\left(Q\left(f_1\right) \circ Q\left(s_1\right)^{-1}\right) \circ \cdots \circ\left(Q\left(f_n\right) \circ Q\left(s_n\right)^{-1}\right)\] where \(s_i\in S\). A <em>localizing class</em> \(S\) of a category \(\mathcal A\) is a class of morphisms such that</p><ol><li>all identity morphisms are in \(S\).</li><li>if two morphisms in \(S\) compose, then their composition in in \(S\).</li><li>for any \(f:M\rightarrow N\) and \(s:L\rightarrow N\) with \(s\in S\), exists \(g:K\rightarrow L\) and \(t:K\rightarrow M\) with \(t\in S\) s.t. <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwxLCJNIl0sWzAsMCwiSyJdLFsxLDAsIkwiXSxbMSwxLCJOIl0sWzEsMCwidCIsMix7InN0eWxlIjp7ImJvZHkiOnsibmFtZSI6ImRhc2hlZCJ9fX1dLFswLDMsImYiLDJdLFsyLDMsInMiXSxbMSwyLCJnIiwwLHsic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV1d&embed" width="180" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> commutes.</li><li>for any \(f:N\rightarrow M\) and \(s:N\rightarrow L\) with \(s\in S\), exists \(g:L\rightarrow K\) and \(t:M\rightarrow K\) with \(t\in S\) s.t. <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwxLCJNIl0sWzAsMCwiSyJdLFsxLDAsIkwiXSxbMSwxLCJOIl0sWzAsMSwidCIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImJvZHkiOnsibmFtZSI6ImRhc2hlZCJ9fX1dLFszLDAsImYiXSxbMywyLCJzIiwyXSxbMiwxLCJnIiwyLHsic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV1d&embed" width="180" height="180" style="border-radius: 0px; border: none;"></iframe> commutes.</li><li>for any morphisms \(f,g:M\rightarrow N\), we have \(\exists s\in S, sf=sg \Longleftrightarrow \exists t\in S, ft=gt\)</li></ol><p>This is the categorification of the notion of denominator set when localizing non-commutative rings, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore_condition">Ore condition</a>. In fact a ring can be viewed as an additive category (by delooping). The localizing classes are classes of “nice” morphisms to localize at for which we could develop a description of roofs.</p><p>For a category \(\mathcal A\) and a localizing class \(S\). A morphism \(Q(f)\circ Q(s)^{-1}\) in \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) is represented by a left roof, which is a diagram \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\), and a morphism \(Q(t)^{-1}\circ Q(g)\) with \(t\in S\) is represented by a right roof which is a diagram \(M\xrightarrow{g}L\xleftarrow{t}N\). We say that the two left roofs \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\) and \(M\xleftarrow{t}K\xrightarrow{g}N\) are equivalent if there exists \(p:H\rightarrow L\) and \(q:H\rightarrow K\) such that \(sp,tq\in S\) and the diagram <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNSxbMiwwLCJIIl0sWzEsMSwiTCJdLFszLDEsIksiXSxbMCwyLCJNIl0sWzQsMiwiTiJdLFswLDEsInAiLDJdLFswLDIsInEiXSxbMSwzLCJzIiwyXSxbMiw0LCJnIl0sWzIsMywidCJdLFsxLDQsImYiLDJdXQ==&embed" width="350" height="250" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> commutes. We can show that this is an equivalence relation. The only difficult part is transitivity. This can be done using a diagram chasing argument. We can also define composition of roofs. The composition of the previous two roofs is defined as a composition of the diagram <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNixbMiwwLCJVIl0sWzEsMSwiTCJdLFszLDEsIksiXSxbMCwyLCJNIl0sWzIsMiwiTiJdLFs0LDIsIlAiXSxbMCwxLCJsIiwyXSxbMCwyLCJrIl0sWzEsMywicyIsMl0sWzEsNCwiZiJdLFsyLDQsInQiLDJdLFsyLDUsImciXV0=&embed" width="350" height="250" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> where \(U\) and the associated maps are induced from the fact that \(S\) is a localizing class. We could check that these satisfies all the desirable properties of a composition. Composition respects equivalence of roofs, is associative, and has an identity given by \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf{1}_M} M\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_M} M\). One can check that the category of (equivalence classes of) left roofs \(\mathcal A_S\) is equivalent to right roofs, so we might as well just work with left roofs. We define a functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A_S\) by letting it be identity on objects and for each morphism \(f:M\rightarrow N\), let \(Q(f)\) be the equivalence class of roofs \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf 1_M}M\xrightarrow{f} N\). This satisfies the universal property of localization, hence isomorphic to \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\).</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 2. For \(S\) a localizing class of category \(\mathcal A\), the category \(\mathcal A_S\) and functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A_S\) satisfies the universal property of localization, i.e. \(Q(s)\) is an isomorphism for each \(s\in S\) and is universal w.r.t. it.</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>For the first property, \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf{1}_M}M\xrightarrow{s}N\) has an inverse \(N\xleftarrow{s}M\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_M}M\). Next, suppose \(F:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal B\) is such that \(F(s)\) is an isomorphism for all \(s\in S\), define functor \(G:\mathcal A_S\rightarrow \mathcal B\) as identity on objects, and for morphisms, the following. If \(\phi:M\rightarrow N\) in \(\mathcal A_S\), choose a representing roof \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\), and define \(G(\phi)=F(f)\circ F(s)^{-1}\). It’s not immediately obvious that this is well defined on equivalence classes, but we omit the verification. This obviously satisfies \(F=G\circ Q\). It is left to the reader to verify that \(G\) respects composition, which is the last piece of verification necessary.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>If \(\mathcal A\) is an additive category, then localizing it would also have an additive structure. In fact if \(\mathcal A\) is additive, we may restate the last axiom of localizing class as: for \(f:M\rightarrow N\) exists \(\exists s\in S, sf=0\Longleftrightarrow \exists t\in S, tf=0\). And the inherited additive structure is the obvious one. It is not trivial to check that it is well defined, but again we ommit the verification. Again everything works out as we expected, biproducts, zero objects are preserved, and localization functor is additive. We can also check that \(f=0\) in the localization iff exists \(t\in S\) with \(tf=0\) iff exists \(t\in S\) with \(ft=0\), and \(M=\mathbf 0\) in the localization iff exists \(N\in\mathcal A\) with \((N\xrightarrow{0}M)\in S\) iff exists \(N\in\mathcal A\) with \((M\xrightarrow{0}N)\in S\). These are easy to prove and left as an exercise. Similarly, one can show the localization of abelian categories is abelian. </p><p>Given a triangulated category, a natural question to ask is: when is a localization of it also triangulated? In other words, when is the localizing class compatible with triangulation? For a localizing class \(S\) in the triangulated category \(\mathcal C\), the localization is compatible with triangulation if the following conditions hold</p><ol><li>for each morphism \(f\), we have \(f\in S\) iff \(f[1]\) in \(S\).</li><li>a diagram with \(s,t\in S\) and distinguished rows <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsOCxbMCwwLCJYIl0sWzEsMCwiWSJdLFsyLDAsIloiXSxbMywwLCJYWzFdIl0sWzAsMSwiWF5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzEsMSwiWV5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzIsMSwiWl5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzMsMSwiWF5cXHByaW1lWzFdIl0sWzAsNCwicyJdLFsxLDUsInQiXSxbMiw2LCJ1IiwwLHsic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV0sWzMsNywic1sxXSJdLFswLDFdLFsxLDJdLFsyLDNdLFs0LDVdLFs1LDZdLFs2LDddXQ==&embed" width="300" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> can be completed to a morphism of distinguished triangles. </li></ol><p>We can show that if these conditions hold then the localization \(\mathcal C[S^{-1}]\) inherits the triangulated structure \(QT_{\mathcal C}\), and a triangle is distinguished if it is isomorphic to an image of a distinguished triangle.

This will help us build towards the definition of derived categories. In some sense, triangulated categories are approximations of abelian categories. They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don’t really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories. Instead of kernels, cokernels, and strict morphisms, triangulated categories bypass these notions and start out with “distinguished triangles”, which are similar to exact sequences.</p><span id="more"></span><p>A translation functor on an additive category \(\mathcal C\) is an automorphism \(T:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal C\) where we denote \(T^n(X)=X[n]\) and \(T^nf=f[n]\) for \(n\in\mathbb Z\).

It is then a straightforward consequence by the rotation axiom that for every distinguished triangle \(X\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Z\rightarrow X[1]\), we have the following long exact sequence<br>\[\cdots\rightarrow H(X[i])\xrightarrow{H(u[i])} H(Y[i])\xrightarrow{H(v[i])}H(Z[i])\xrightarrow{H(w[i])}H(X[i+1])\rightarrow\cdots\] What we just proved in part 3 of the previous theorem is that the Hom-functor is cohomological. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. An object in an abelian category is <em>simple</em> if the only subobjects are zero and the object itself, and semisimple if it is a coproduct of simple objects. An abelian category is semisimple if every short exact sequence splits.</p></blockquote><p>Caution: some authors call a category semisimple if all objects are semisimple, which is a stronger definition and is NOT equivalent to our definition. Every semisimple abelian category has a triangulated structure. To do this, we let the translation functor be the identity functor, and we declare a triangle \(X\xrightarrow{u} Y\xrightarrow{v} Z\xrightarrow{w} X\) distinguished if it is “exact” at \(X\), i.e. \(\mathrm{Ker}(u)=\mathrm{Im}(w)\). Verifying this is a triangulated category is a tedious, and we will not do it here. Moreover, all abelian triangulated categories are semisimple. We will not prove this either. In fact, the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\) is triangulated. To see this, we set the distinguished triangles to be the ones isomorphic to a standard triangle of the form \[X^\bullet\xrightarrow{f^\bullet} Y^\bullet \xrightarrow{i_f^\bullet} \mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\xrightarrow{p_f^\bullet} X^\bullet[1]\] and as expected, the cohomology functor \(H^n:K(\mathcal A)\rightarrow\mathcal A\) is cohomological.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Continuing last week where we defined the homotopy category of complexes, we will take a look at triangulated categories. This will help us build towards the definition of derived categories. In some sense, triangulated categories are approximations of abelian categories. They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don’t really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories. Instead of kernels, cokernels, and strict morphisms, triangulated categories bypass these notions and start out with “distinguished triangles”, which are similar to exact sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, I read from the wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry">homological mirror symmetry</a> that the derived category of coherent sheaves is a popular research topic in algebraic geometry. Also, I’ve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don’t understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\).</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition 1.

Moreover, we denote by \(0_{A,B}\) (or \(0\) if there is no confusion) the identity element of \(\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\).</p></blockquote><p>Note \(0_{A,B}\) is the zero morphism since it’s the unique morphism \(A\rightarrow B\) which factors through \(\mathbf 0\), i.e. \(A\rightarrow\mathbf 0\rightarrow B\).  In particular, note that \(0_{A,B}\circ f=0_{X,A}\) and \(g\circ 0_{A,B}=0_{B,X}\) for any \(f:X\rightarrow A\) and \(g:B\rightarrow X\), for any object \(X\). We note that equivalently, an additive functor maybe defined as a functor that preserves all finite biproducts.</p><p>We recall that in a category \(\mathcal C\), the equalizer \(\mathrm{Eq}(f,g)\) of morphisms \(f,g:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(E\in\mathcal C\) and a morphism \(e:E\rightarrow A\) s.t. the diagram \(E\rightarrow A\rightrightarrows B\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. Dually, the coequalizer \(\mathrm{Coeq}(f,g)\) is an object \(Q\in\mathcal C\) and a morphism \(q:B\rightarrow Q\) s.t. the diagram \( A\rightrightarrows B\rightarrow Q\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. In an additive category, for a morphism \(f:A\rightarrow B\), define its kernel \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)=\mathrm{Eq}(f,0_{A,B})\), cokernel \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)=\mathrm{Coeq}(f,0_{A,B})\). Spelled out explicitly, a kernel of \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(K\) and a morphism \(k:K\rightarrow A\) such that \(f\circ k=0_{K,B}\), and given any \(K^\prime\) and \(k^\prime:K^\prime\rightarrow A\) with \(f\circ k^\prime=0_{K^\prime,B}\), there exists unique \(u:K^\prime\rightarrow K\) s.t. \(k\circ u=k^\prime\).</p><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMSwwLCJBIl0sWzIsMCwiQiJdLFswLDAsIksiXSxbMCwxLCJLXlxccHJpbWUiXSxbMCwxLCJmIl0sWzIsMCwiayJdLFsyLDEsIjBfe0ssQn0iLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMywwLCJrXlxccHJpbWUiLDIseyJsYWJlbF9wb3NpdGlvbiI6NjB9XSxbMywxLCIwX3tLXlxccHJpbWUsQn0iLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6Mn1dLFszLDIsInUiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XV0=&embed" height="190" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe><p>Dually, a cokernel of \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(Q\) with a morphism \(q:B\rightarrow Q\) with \(q\circ f=0_{A,Q}\), such that for any object \(Q^\prime\) and morphism \(q^\prime:B\rightarrow Q\) with \(q^\prime\circ f=0_{A,Q^\prime}\), there exists unique \(u:Q\rightarrow Q^\prime\) such that \(q^\prime=u\circ q\).</p><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJBIl0sWzEsMCwiQiJdLFsyLDAsIlEiXSxbMiwxLCJRXlxccHJpbWUiXSxbMCwxLCJmIl0sWzEsMiwicSJdLFsxLDMsInFeXFxwcmltZSIsMl0sWzIsMywidSIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImJvZHkiOnsibmFtZSI6ImRhc2hlZCJ9fX1dLFswLDIsIjBfe0EsUX0iLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMCwzLCIwX3tBLFFeXFxwcmltZX0iLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6Mn1dXQ==&embed" height="190" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe><p>Recall a subobject of an object \(X\) is an object \(A\) with a monomorphism \(A\hookrightarrow X\), and a quotient object of \(X\) is an object \(Q\) with an epimorphism \(X\twoheadrightarrow Q\).

In fact, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%27s_embedding_theorem">Freyd–Mitchell embedding theorem</a> states that any abelian category can be embedded to the category of \(R\)-modules for some \(R\) via a fully faithful functor. So we may use element-wise diagram chasing in abelian categories, which may help us derive diagram chasing theorems such as \(5\)-lemma and snake lemma. In an abelian category, all finite limits and colimits exist, in particular, pullbacks exist and they preserve monomorphisms and epimorphisms. </p><blockquote><p>Lemma 3.

First, we have \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\rightarrow Y\) is zero and \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\) is zero, so we have a factorization \(X\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow Y\) by the universal property of cokernels. It remains to show that \(\beta:\mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow Y\) is a monomorphism. Suppose \(\varphi_1,\varphi_2:Z\rightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\) with \(\beta\circ \varphi_1=\beta\circ \varphi_2\), therefore \(\beta\circ \sigma=0\) where \(\sigma=\varphi_1-\varphi_2\). Consider the pullback \(W=X\times_{\mathrm{Coim}(f)}Z\) with \(\tau:W\rightarrow Z\) and \(\pi:W\rightarrow X\) of the maps \(\mathrm{Coim}(f)\) and \(\sigma\). We note that \(f\circ\pi=\beta\circ\mathrm{Coim}(f)\circ \pi=\beta\circ\sigma\circ\tau=0\), so \(\pi\) factors through \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\) by \(W\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\) say \(w:W\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(f)\). Therefore, \(\sigma\circ\tau=\mathrm{Coim}(f)\circ \mathrm{Ker}(f)\circ w=0\circ w=0\). Since pullbacks preserve epimorphisms, \(\tau\) is epic.

We denote by \(\overline{f}:\mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow \mathrm{Im}(f)\) the map induced by this factorization, and say \(f\) is <em>strict</em> if \(\overline{f}\) is an isomorphism. </p><!-- --><blockquote><p>Theorem 4.

Since \(\mathrm{Coim}(f)\hookrightarrow B\) is monic, it is the kernel of its cokernel, so it is the kernel of \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)\). Since \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\) in our construction is also the kernel of \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)\), the induced map \(\overline{f}\) is an isomorphism by the universal property of kernels.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>In an abelian category, suppose \(f:A\rightarrow B\) and \(g:B\rightarrow C\) are such that \(g\circ f=0\). We factor \(A\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\), and since \(A\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\rightarrow C\) is zero and \(A\twoheadrightarrow\mathrm{Im}(f)\) is epic, we have \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\rightarrow C\) is zero.

We say such sequence \(A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\) is <em>exact</em> if the canonical map is an isomorphism.

If \(A\) is a category, let \(C(\mathcal A)\) be the category of chain complexes in \(\mathcal A\) with chain maps are morphisms. If \(\mathcal A\) is additive, then \(C(\mathcal A)\) inherits an obvious group structure on its morphisms, and they make it an additive category as well. Also, if \(\mathcal A\) is abelian then so is \(C(\mathcal A)\). Let \(C^+(\mathcal A)\) be the full subcategory of \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded below (exists \(N\in\mathbb Z\) s.t. \(A^i=\mathbb 0\) for \(i &lt; N \)), and similarly \(C^-(\mathcal A)\) is the full subcategory \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded above. Let \(C^b(\mathcal A)\) be the full subcategory of \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded below and above.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 5.

In fact, for a chain map \(f^\bullet: A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\), we associate an induced morphism \(H^nf^\bullet:H^n(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(B^\bullet)\), which makes \(H^n\) an additive functor \(C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow\mathcal A\). Moreover, \(f^\bullet\) is said to be a <em>quasi-isomorphism</em> if \(H^nf^\bullet\) is an isomorphism for all \(n\in\mathbb Z\).</p></blockquote><p>Let \(\mathcal A\) be an abelian category. The <em>translation functor</em> \(T:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C(\mathcal A)\) sends a complex \(A^\bullet =(A^i,d^i)\) to the complex \(T(A^\bullet) =(A^{i+1},-d^{i+1})\), and \(T(f^\bullet):T(A^\bullet)\rightarrow T(B^\bullet)\) for \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is given by \(T(f^\bullet)^i=f^{i+1}\). The functor essentially shifts the complex left by one, where the negative sign of the differential is a convention useful later. We denote by \(A^\bullet[n]=T^n(A^\bullet)\) for \(n\in\mathbb Z\) (negative integers correspond to right translations). The right truncation functor \(\tau_{\le n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C^-(\mathcal A)\) sends a complex in the following way <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMTAsWzIsMCwiQV5uIl0sWzIsMSwiXFxtYXRocm17S2VyfShkXntufSkiXSxbMSwwLCJBXntuLTF9Il0sWzMsMCwiQV57bisxfSJdLFsxLDEsIkFee24tMX0iXSxbMywxLCJcXG1hdGhiZnswfSJdLFs0LDAsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbMCwwLCJcXGNkb3RzIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxjZG90cyJdLFs0LDEsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbMCwxLCIiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJ0YWlsIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJtYXBzIHRvIn19fV0sWzIsMF0sWzAsM10sWzQsMSwiIiwyLHsiY29sb3VyIjpbMCw2MCw2MF19XSxbMSw1XSxbMyw2XSxbNywyXSxbOCw0XSxbNSw5XV0=&embed" width="375" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> where the red arrow is induced via universal property. The functor \(\tau_{\le n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow \mathcal A\) sends the morphisms in the obvious way. Moreover, we have a canonical monomorphism \(\tau_{\le n}(A^\bullet)\rightarrow A^\bullet\) which induces isomorphisms on their cohomology objects. The left truncation functor \(\tau_{\ge n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C^+(\mathcal A)\) is defined dually. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 6. Suppose \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is a morphism in \(C(\mathcal A)\) for some abelian category \(\mathcal A\). The <em>cone</em> of \(f^\bullet\) is \(\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)=A^\bullet[1]\oplus B^\bullet\). Spelled out explicitly, the cochain complex consists of objects \(A^{n+1}\oplus B^n\), and the differential \(d^n:A^{n+1}\oplus B^n\rightarrow A^{n+2}\oplus B^{n+1}\) is given by<br>\[d^n=\begin{pmatrix}-d_{A^\bullet}^{n+1}&amp;0\\ f^{n+1}&amp; d_{B^\bullet}^n\end{pmatrix}\]acting as though on column vectors.</p></blockquote><p>We remark that a short exact sequence of complexes induces a long exact sequence of cohomology. Say we have<br>\[\mathbf 0\longrightarrow A^{\bullet}\xrightarrow{\ f^{\bullet}\ } B^\bullet\xrightarrow{\ g^\bullet\ }  C^\bullet\longrightarrow\mathbf 0\]a short exact sequence of complexes, then for each \(n\), exists \(\delta^n:H^n(C^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(A^\bullet)\) making<br>\[\cdots\rightarrow H^n(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(B^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(C^\bullet)\xrightarrow{\delta^n} H^{n+1}(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(B^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(C^\bullet)\rightarrow\cdots\]exact. This is a very common construction in homological algebra, and the way we construct these connecting morphisms is by applying the snake lemma twice. Suppose \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is a chain map with cone \(C^\bullet=\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\), then the map \(<br>\iota^{n}=0 \oplus \operatorname{Id}_{B^{n}}: B^{n} \rightarrow C^{n}<br>\) and the canonical projection \(\rho^n:C^n\rightarrow A^{n+1}\) gives chain maps \(\iota^\bullet:B^\bullet\rightarrow C^\bullet\) and \(\rho^\bullet:C^\bullet \rightarrow A^\bullet [1]\) which fits into a short exact sequence \[\mathbf 0\longrightarrow B^{\bullet}\xrightarrow{\ \iota^{\bullet}\ } C^\bullet\xrightarrow{\ \rho^\bullet\ }  A^\bullet[1]\longrightarrow\mathbf 0\]Hence this induces a long exact sequence on cohomology objects. Working out the connecting morphism, we find out that the connecting morphisms are nothing more than the induced morphisms \(\delta^n=H^{n+1}f^\bullet\). From this fact, we deduce that \(f^\bullet\) is a quasi-isomorphism iff the cone \(\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\) is acyclic. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 7. Suppose \(\mathcal A\) is an abelian category. An object \(X\) in \(\mathcal A\) is <em>injective</em> (resp. <em>projective</em>) if the contravariant (resp. covariant) left exact (resp. right exact) hom-functor \(\mathrm{Hom}(-,X):\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathbf{Ab}\) (resp. \(\mathrm{Hom}(X,-):\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathbf{Ab}\)) is exact. Moreover, we say \(\mathcal A\) has <em>enough injectives</em> (resp. <em>enough projectives</em>) if for any object \(Y\) there is an injective object (resp. projective object) \(X\) and a monomorphism \(Y\rightarrow X\) (resp. epimorphism \(X\rightarrow Y\)). An <em>injective resolution</em> of an object \(X\) is a complex \(I^\bullet\) bounded below \(0\) and a quasi-isomorphism \(X\rightarrow I^\bullet\), or equivalently, an exact sequence<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow X\rightarrow I^0\rightarrow I^1\rightarrow \cdots\]where each \(I^i\) is injective. Dually, a <em>projective resolution</em> of an object \(X\) is a complex \(P_\bullet\) bounded above \(0\) and a quasi-isomorphism \(P_\bullet\rightarrow X\), or equivalently, an exact sequence\[\cdots\rightarrow P_1\rightarrow P_0\rightarrow X\rightarrow \mathbf 0\]where each \(P_i\) is projective.</p></blockquote><p>It is a familiar result in homological algebra that if an abelian category has enough injectives (resp. enough projectives) then every object has an injective resolution (resp. projective resolution).

This implies that additive functors take split exact sequences to split exact sequences.<br>Suppose \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is a left exact functor betweeen abelian categories, then applying \(\mathscr{F}\) to a short exact sequence \(\mathbf 0\rightarrow A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\) gives a short exact sequence \(\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(C)\). A natural question to ask is whether we could continue this exact sequence to the right. It turns out that there is a canonical way of doing so, by defining the right derived functors \(R^i\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal B\), we may continue the exact sequence<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(C)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(C)\rightarrow\cdots\]Note that \(\mathscr{F}\) is exact iff \(R^1\mathscr{F}=0\), so in a sense the right derived functors measures how far \(\mathscr{F}\) is from exact.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 8. Let \(\mathcal A,\mathcal B\) be abelian categories and \(\mathcal A\) has enough injectives. Suppose \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is a left-exact functor. Let \(X\in\mathcal A\) and suppose \(I^\bullet\) is an injective resolution, then we obtain a complex<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(I^0)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(I^1)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(I^2)\rightarrow\cdots\]Define the right derived functors as the additive functors \(R^i\mathscr{F};\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\)<br>\[R^i\mathscr{F}(X)=H^i(\mathscr{F}I^\bullet)\]for \(i\ge 0\). Left derived functors \(L_i\mathscr{F}\) are defined dually via projective resolution.</p></blockquote><p>The most important examples of derived functors are the Ext and Tor functors. The Ext functor is the right derived functor of the hom-functor, and the Tor functor is the left derived functor of tensor product. Recall that there is a tensor-Hom adjunction \(\mathrm{Hom}(Y\otimes X,Z)\cong \mathrm{Hom}(Y,\mathrm{Hom}(X,Z))\), so these functors are related very closely.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 9. For \(A,B\in \mathbf{Mod}_R\), define the Ext functors\[\begin{aligned}\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(A,B)&amp;=(R^i\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,-))(B)\\ &amp;\cong (R^i\mathrm{Hom}_R(-,B))(A)\end{aligned} \] and the Tor functors \[\begin{aligned}\mathrm{Tor}_i^R(A,B)&amp;= (L_i(A\otimes_R -))(B)\\ &amp;\cong (L_i(-\otimes_R B))(A)\end{aligned}\] for all \(i\ge 0\).</p></blockquote><!--- --><blockquote><p>Example 10. Derived functors can help us defined many (co)homology theory.</p><ol><li><em>Sheaf cohomology.</em> Let \(X\) be a topological space, then the global section functor \(\Gamma:\mathrm{Sh}(X)\rightarrow \mathbf{Ab}\) which sends \(\mathscr{F} \mapsto \mathscr{F}(X)\) is left exact, its right derived functor \(H^i(X,-):\mathrm{Sh}(X)\rightarrow \mathbf{Ab}\) is the <em>sheaf cohomology</em> \(H^i(X,\mathscr{F})\). Its special cases include the de Rham cohomology. </li><li><em>Group cohomology.</em> Let \(k\) be an algebraically closed field and \(G\) a group, then the invariant functor \((-)^G:\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\rightarrow\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\), which is the same as \(\mathrm{Hom}_{k[G]}(k,-)\), is left exact, its right derived functor \(H^i(G;-):\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\rightarrow\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\) gives the group cohomology \(H^i(G;M)=\mathrm{Ext}^i_{k[G]}(k,M)\).</li><li><em>Hochschild cohomology.</em> This one I’m not really familiar, so I will not write about it in detail.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The derived functors are natural in the sense that if we have a morphism of two short exact sequence in \(\mathcal A\), then the induced morphisms of the long exact sequences in \(\mathcal B\) commutes with the long exact sequences. Finally, I’d like to finish with the definition of the homotopy category of complexes. We say that a chain map is <em>nullhomotopic</em> if it is homotopic to the zero chain.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 11. Let \(\mathcal A\) be an abelian category, the <em>homotopy category of complexes</em> \( K(\mathcal A)\) is the category where objects are (co)chain complexes in \(\mathcal A\) and morphisms are chain maps up to homotopy, i.e. \[\mathrm{Hom}_{K(\mathcal A)}(A^\bullet,B^\bullet)=\mathrm{Hom}_{C(\mathcal A)}(A^\bullet,B^\bullet)/G\] where \(G\) is the subgroup of nullhomotopic chain maps.</p></blockquote><p>There are many things that needs to be checked here for it to be well defined, which we omit. We will see that this category is not typically abelian, but it is triangulated. A triangulated category is an approximation of an abelian category.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;I have always been curious about derived categories. In particular, I read from the wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry&quot;&gt;homological mirror symmetry&lt;/a&gt; that the derived category of coherent sheaves is a popular research topic in algebraic geometry. Also, I’ve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don’t understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\).&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“Why did the two algebraic geometers get arrested at the airport? Because they were talking about blowing up six points on the plane.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Anonymous </p></blockquote><p>I spent my last week in Quebec attending the <a href="https://cumc.math.ca/2022/presentation-database">Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2022</a>. It was really an intense week of learning. I learned a lot and met many smart and interesting people. So I wanted to write about the things I learned and the people I met during the conference. There were so many excellent talks but unfortunately I could only attend some of them. In particular, there are some very good ones in geometry, topology, representation theory, algebra, logic theory, etc. </p><span id="more"></span><ol><li><em>When Polynomials don’t Commute: An Introduction to Ore Extensions</em> by Nick Priebe. Non-commutative algebra is a central topic in modern algebra research, which concerns objects such as non-commutative rings. Suppose \(R\) is a ring, \(\sigma:R\rightarrow R\) a homomorphism, \(\delta:R\rightarrow R\) a \(\sigma\)-derivation i.e. a homomorphism s.t. \(\delta(rs)=\sigma(r)\delta(s)+\delta(r)s\), then an <em>Ore extension</em> or a <em>skew polynomial ring</em> is the noncommutative ring \(R[x;\sigma,\delta]\) where the multiplication satisfies \(xr=\sigma(r)x+\delta(r)\). Nick provided some examples of noncommutative rings that are useful in physics. He also introduced some basic results and open problems about their representations. I am actually quite curious about the relationship between noncommutative algebra and noncommutative geometry.</li><li><em>A Brief Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory</em> by Jacob Eater. Homotopy type theory is a new foundation of mathematics which is developed from intuitionist type theory. In HoTT, the fundamental objects are types, and we can build dependent types with \(\sum_{(x:A)}B(x)\) (analogue of \(\exists x\in A,B(x)\)) and \(\prod_{(x:A)}B(x)\) (analogue of \(\forall x\in A,B(x)\)). To avoid Russell’s paradox, we can build a tower of universes. Jacob also introduced Voevodsky’s Univalence axiom \((A= B)\simeq (A\simeq B)\) so isomorphic objects are equal. HoTT is very analogous to homotopy theory in the sense of its \(\infty\)-groupoid structure. Currently there is a lot of research in their higher-categorical models and their application in computer proof assistants.</li><li><em>Waring Squaring</em> by Maya Gusak. A classical result in number theory is that each natural number is the sum of at most four squares. Waring’s problem asks for which \(k\in\mathbb N\) exists \(s\in\mathbb Z^+\) s.t. each \(n\in\mathbb N\) can be written as a sum \(n=n_1^k+n_2^k+\cdots+n_s^k\), where \(n_1,\dots,n_s\in\mathbb N\). To tackle this problem, mathematicians used so called circle method. Additionally, this method can be used to prove Vinogradov’s theorem (every odd natural number \(n&gt;5\) is the sum of three primes), but fails to solve Goldbach conjecture.</li><li><em>ADE Classification for Quivers of Finite Representation Type</em> by Xinrui You. A quiver is a multidigraph (i.e. a directed graph with multiple edges and loops allowed) which simulates underlying structure of a category. A representation of a quiver sends each vertex to a vector space or a module and each edge to a morphism. These representations decompose just as representations of finite groups. One fundamental result in the classification of quivers is Gabriel’s theorem. Gabriel’s theorem says that a quiver of finite representation type is a union of Dynkin graphs of type A, D, or E. </li><li><em>The Nash Embedding Theorem for Tori in \(3\)-space</em> by Diba Heydary. A fundamental result in Riemannian geometry is that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically (preserving the length of every path) embedded into a Euclidean space. Diba talked about a specific example of an embedding of a torus in the Euclidean \(3\)-space. A torus has a polygonal representation which can be used to create this embedding. Whitney embedding theorem is a similar result for differentiable manifolds.</li><li><em>Dissection of Polyhedra and the Dehn invariant</em> by James Bona-Landry. The Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem says that that two polygons can be dissected and transformed to each other iff they have the same area. The natural generalization of this question into \(3\) dimensions does not hold. This is due to the Dehn invariant \(\sum_i\ell_i\otimes \theta_i\in \mathbb R\otimes (\mathbb R/2\pi \mathbb Z)\). We can show that there are polyhedra that share same volume but has different Dehn invariant, which means they can not transform to each other via dissection. In fact the Dehn-Sydler theorem says that they can transform to each other via dissection iff they have the same volume and same Dehn invariant. The generalization for higher dimensions is still open.</li><li><em>An Introduction to Linear Logic</em> by Amélie Comtois. Linear logic is different from classical logic in that if \(A\rightarrow B\) is used then \(A\) is no longer available anymore. She also talked about sequent calculus, which is a formal calculus of logic. Linear logic uses drastically different logical symbols than classical logic as well. Linear logic is an extension of classical logic, and classical logic can be realized in linear logic. Linear logic is thought of as the language of quantum theory. Moreover, I discussed with Amélie about category theory, and I learned from her about multicategories and higher categories. </li><li><em>Exploring Quivers, Representations, and Varieties via Multisegments</em> by Iretomiwa Ajala. This is another talk about quivers, and much more technical than that of Xinrui. Iretomiwa introduced multisegments, and discussed how they related to quivers of type A. He also mentions parabolic induction, which is a method of obtaining a representation of a reductive group from the representations of its parabolic subgroups. </li><li><em>An Introduction to Coxeter Groups and the Properties of their Weak Order</em> by Kimia Shaban. A very interesting talk on the combinatorial side of Coxeter groups. Coxeter groups are a type of groups generated by reflections. She discussed their classification, and the Sperner property of the weak order on Coxeter groups. In the end, she also talked about a conjecture she and her supervisor wish to disprove about the Sperner property of the weak order. </li><li><em>Univariate Tropical Polynomials</em> by Charlotte Lavoie-Bel. Tropical polynomical replace addition with the minimum function and multiplication by the usual addition, which makes it a semifield. Tropical polynomials can be graphed and they will have a cell-looking structure. They can be thought of as the limit of logarithm under base \(0\). They also have a different notion of roots than regular polynomials. We can consider zero locus of tropical polynomials i.e. tropical varieties. The tropical version of some classical algebraic geometry theorems such as Riemann–Roch theorem, can be proven by combinatorial arguments. I like her quote that “tropical geometry is the combinatorial shadow of classical algebraic geometry”.</li></ol><p>There are many other excellent talks that I unfortunately did not attend, and I only wrote about some of the talks I went to. I also gave my own talk on Schubert calculus and cohomology of Grassmannians as the last student speaker of the conference, which you can view in a <a href="/archives/a5b2dbed/">previous post</a>.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

This is because one of the objectives of my URA is to generalise my <a href="/archives/66165fd0/">previous blog post</a> about a fraction of an \(S_n\)-orbit on a hyperplane to Weyl groups. First, a Lie algebra is <em>simple</em> if it is of degree greater than \(1\) (so we are excluding the one dimensional abelian Lie algebras) and has no proper ideals, and a semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. Equivalently, a Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) is semisimple if \(\mathrm{rad}(\mathfrak{g})\), the sum of all solvable ideals (or the maximal solvable ideal), is trivial. Any semisimple Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group \(G\). Let \(\mathrm{ad}:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g})\) by \((\mathrm{ad} X)(Z)=[X,Z]\) be the <em>adjoint representation</em>. Let \(B:\mathfrak{g}\times \mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathbf C\) be the symmetric bilinear form defined by \(B(X,Y)=\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{ad}X\mathrm{ad} Y)\), called the <em>Killing form</em> which is invariant in the sense of \(B([X,Y],Z)=B(X,[Y,Z])\). Cartan’s criterion for semisimplicity says that a Lie algebra is semisimple iff the associated Killing form is nondegenerate. From now on, we let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be a semisimple Lie algebra over \(\mathbf C\). We start by discussing the root–space decomposition \(\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}\oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Phi}\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}\) of semisimple Lie algebras.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Root–space-decomposition"><a href="#Root–space-decomposition" class="headerlink" title="Root–space decomposition"></a>Root–space decomposition</h4><p>Before we begin, we review some terminology. We say that \(\mathfrak{g}\) is abelian if the Lie bracket is identically zero, and a subspace \(\mathfrak{i}\) is an ideal if \([X,Y]\in\mathfrak{i}\) for all \(X\in \mathfrak{g}\) and \(Y\in\mathfrak{i}\). Examples include \(Z(\mathfrak{g})=\{Z\in\mathfrak{g}:[X,Z]=0,\forall X\in\mathfrak{g}\}\) called the center, \(N_{\mathfrak{g}}(k)=\{X\in\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]\in k,\,\forall K\in k\}\) called the normaliser where \(k\) is a subspace of \(\mathfrak g\), and \(C_{\mathfrak g}(k)=\{X\in\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]=0,\,\forall K\in k\}\) called the centraliser where \(k\) is a subset of \(\mathfrak g\). For ideals \(\mathfrak{i},\mathfrak{j}\) of \(\mathfrak{g}\), define \([\mathfrak{i},\mathfrak{j}]\) to be the ideal spanned by \([X,Y]\) where \(X\in \mathfrak{i},Y\in \mathfrak{j}\). We say \(\mathfrak{g}\) is <em>nilpotent</em> if the chain \(\mathfrak{g}\ge [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]\ge [\mathfrak{g},[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]]\ge \cdots\) called the lower central series terminates in zero. We say \(\mathfrak{g}\) is <em>solvable</em> if the chain \(\mathfrak{g}\ge [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]\ge [[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}],[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]]\ge \cdots\) called the derived series terminates in zero. We say \(X\in\mathfrak{g}\) is <em>ad-nilpotent</em> if \(\mathrm{ad}X\) is a nilpotent endomorphism, and semisimple if \(\mathrm{ad}X\) is diagonalisable. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 1.

Also, we note that \(\Phi\) spans \(\mathfrak h^*\). In the next section, we define abstract root systems and formalize how we could obtain the Weyl group from \(\Phi\). There is a different way we could define Weyl groups using <a href="https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Maximal_torus">maximal torus</a>.</p><h4 id="Root-systems"><a href="#Root-systems" class="headerlink" title="Root systems"></a>Root systems</h4><p>A root system is a configuration of vectors in the euclidean space that satisfies some geometric properties, which helps us with some classification problems in representation theory of Lie algebras. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 3.

A root system \(\Phi\) is <em>reducible</em> if \(\Phi=\Phi_1\cup\Phi_2\) s.t. \((\alpha,\beta)=0\) for all \(\alpha\in\Phi_1\) and \(\beta\in\Phi_2\).</p></blockquote><p>We can draw diagrams of root systems, for example, the following is an example of a root system called \(G_2\). This is in fact an irreducible root system. It does not decompose into disjoint unions that are orthogonal to each other.</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/Root_system_G2.svg" alt="The root system G2" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"></p><p>I credit this picture to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Root_system_G2.svg">this page</a> of the wikipedia media repository. Here’s another picture of the root system \(C_3\) (arising from the sympletic Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{sp}_{6}\)) drawn by my friend Maya, and a physical model we made together using coffee stirrers (it may not be the most accurate model but it’s hard work). </p><p align="center"><img src="/images/IMG_5337.JPG" alt="The root system C3" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"><img src="/images/IMG_5342.JPG" alt="Physical model of the root system C3" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;"></p><p>The <em>Weyl</em> group of a root system \(\Phi\) is the group of all reflections \(W(\Phi)=\{\sigma_{\alpha}:\alpha\in\Phi\}\le \mathrm{GL}(E)\). This is a <em>Coxeter group</em>, i.e. a group with a presentation of the form \(\langle r_1,\dots,r_n\mid (r_ir_j)^{m_{i,j}}\rangle\) where \(m_{i,i}=1\) and \(m_{i,j}&gt;1\) for \(i\ne j\) where \(m_{i,j}=\infty\) when there are no relation. The Weyl group acts faithfully on the roots. For a Lie algebra \(\mathfrak g\) with root space decomposition \(\mathfrak h\oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Phi}\mathfrak g_{\alpha}\), the set \(\Phi\) is a root system. The Weyl chambers of a root system is the set of connected components of the complement of the union of all hyperplanes perpendicular to a root. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 4. A <em>base</em> for the root system is a subset \(\Delta\subseteq\Phi\), whose elements are called <em>simple roots</em>, such that \(\Delta\) is a basis for \(E\), and each root is a linear combination of \(\Delta\) with integer coefficients such that the coefficients are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive, which are called the positive and negative roots with respect to \(\Delta\). The <em>height</em> of a root with respect to \(\Delta\) is the sum of all its coefficients in the basis \(\Delta\).</p></blockquote><p>Equivalently, we can take a hyperplane not containing any root and define the positive roots as a fixed side, where the simple roots are the positive roots that cannot be written as the sum of two positive roots. The simple roots generate the Weyl group. The <em>fundamental Weyl chamber</em> associated to a base \(\Delta\) is the set of points \(\{v\in E:(\alpha,v)&gt;0,\forall \alpha\in \Delta\}\). For each root \(\alpha\), define the coroot \(\alpha^{\lor}=\frac{2}{\langle \alpha,\alpha\rangle}\alpha\), the set of coroots forms the dual of the root system \(\Phi^\lor\).</p><h4 id="Classification-of-root-systems"><a href="#Classification-of-root-systems" class="headerlink" title="Classification of root systems"></a>Classification of root systems</h4><p>For \(\alpha,\beta\in\Phi\), since \(\cos(\theta_{\alpha,\beta})=\frac{(\alpha,\beta)^2}{(\alpha,\alpha)(\beta,\beta)}\), we have \(\langle \alpha,\beta\rangle\langle \beta,\alpha\rangle=4\cos^2(\theta_{\alpha,\beta})\le 4\) which is an integer by assumption. Thus, we can list all the possibilities for the angles and for \(\langle \alpha,\beta\rangle\)</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/table.png" alt="Table of angles of roots" style="height: 181px; width: 322px;"></p><p>If \(\Delta\) is a base for \(\Phi\), then the Cartan matrix associated to \(\Delta\) is \(C=(\langle\alpha_i,\alpha_j \rangle)\in\mathrm{Mat}_{\ell}(\mathbf Z)\) where \(\Delta=\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_{\ell}\}\) where \(\ell=|\Delta|\). Changing the order of roots just permutes the Cartan matrix’s rows and columns. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 5. The <em>Dynkin diagram</em> of a root system \(\Phi\) with respect to a base \(\Delta\) is a graph with undirected or directed edges with possibly multiple edges, such that the vertices are \(\Delta\) and the number of edges between \(\alpha,\beta\in\Delta\) is \(\max(|\langle\alpha,\beta \rangle|,|\langle \beta,\alpha\rangle |)\), directed towards the longer root if the number of edges is more than one.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously the root system is irreducible iff the Dynkin diagram is connected. Two root systems are isomorphic iff they have the same Dynkin diagram. A classification of all Dynkin diagrams can be found <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~julia/teaching/581C_Fall2010/Snow_Lecture.pdf">here</a>. The bases for the root systems according to these classification can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_system#Explicit_construction_of_the_irreducible_root_systems">here</a>. The simply laced (no multiple edges) Dynkin diagrams shows up in classification problems in many different areas in mathematics: labelled graphs, quivers, 2d conformal field theories, etc. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_classification">ADE classification</a>.</p><p>The Dynkin diagram also tells us information about the presentation of the Weyl group. For two distinct simple roots \(s,r\in\Delta\), the order \(m\) of \(sr\) in the presentation of the Weyl group is determined by the number of edges between their corresponding vertices in the Dynkin diagram. If there are no edges then \(m=2\), if there is one edge then \(m=3\), if there are two edges then \(m=4\), and if there are three edges then \(m=6\).</p><h4 id="Bruhat-order-on-Coxeter-groups"><a href="#Bruhat-order-on-Coxeter-groups" class="headerlink" title="Bruhat order on Coxeter groups"></a>Bruhat order on Coxeter groups</h4><p>An important step in Pawlowski’s paper was bounding \(\mathcal O(v,w)\) using the antichains in the Bruhat order. The Bruhat order can in fact be defined over any Coxeter group.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 6. If \(W\) is a Coxeter group with standard generators \(S\), the <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(W\) is defined by \(u\le v\) iff some substring of a \(S\)-reduced word for \(v\) is a \(S\)-reduced word for \(u\).</p></blockquote><p>As an example, we calculate the Weyl group of the root system arising from \(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}\) and its Bruhat order. From Example 2.3 earlier, we have \(\Phi=\{\pm e_i\pm e_j:i\ne j\}\cup\{\pm 2e_k:k\}\). To compute the presentation, we first choose a set of simple roots \(\Delta=\{2e_1,e_2-e_1,e_3-e_2,\dots,e_{n}-e_{n-1}\}\), and by computing the Cartan matrix, we derive the following Dynkin diagram which then determines the Weyl group \(W(\Phi)\).</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/IMG_5343.JPG" alt="Weyl group and Dynkin diagram of Sp(2n)" style="height: 390px; width: 610px;"></p><p>Next, we find the reduced words in the group. For a word in this group, if two neighboring letters differ by an index greater than \(1\) then we cannot reduce the two letters further, and if they do not differ then they reduce to \(1\). Thus the reduced words are the concatonation of proper substrings of \((s_1s_2)^4\) and \((s_ks_{k+1})^3\) for \(k\ge 2\) such that each neighboring pair of such block do not form the string \((s_1s_2)^4\) or \((s_ks_{k+1})^3\) for \(k\ge 2\) and such that the two neighboring ends are not the same letter. For example, the word \(s_3s_4s_3s_4s_5s_4s_5s_7s_6\) is reduced. Observe that the reduced words are unique. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

Sylvester </p></blockquote><p>This week is the first week of the spring term and also my first week of undergraduate research with Prof. Satriano, so I decided to write about a research paper I’ve given to read, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08535.pdf">this one</a>. In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \(\sigma\in S_n\) acts on \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) by permutation, and let \(\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\{\sigma\in S_n: w\cdot \sigma v=0\}\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \(\sum_ix_i=0\), where \(n\ge 3\). In notations, we have the following theorem.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Theorem 1. For \(n\ge 3\), we have<br>\[\max\{|\mathcal{O}(v,w)|: v\in S,w\in\mathbf{R}^n\}=2\lfloor n/2\rfloor (n-2)!\]where \(S=\{v\in \mathbf R^n: v\cdot \mathbf{1}\ne 0, v\mathrm{\ has\ distinct\ coordinates}\}\).</p></blockquote><p>An explicit construction that achieves this bound is given by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, so it suffice to show that this is the best bound.

Let \(X_{\alpha}\) be the set of ordered set partitions of type \(\alpha\). Naturally, we have \(\alpha^*\in X_{\alpha}\) where \(\alpha^*_j=\{i_j+1,i_j+2,\dots,i_{j+1}\}\). Let \(S(\alpha)=\{i_1,\dots,i_{m-1}\}\). We have \(S_n\) acts on \(X_{\alpha}\) by element, which is a transitive action. Thus identify \(X_{\alpha}\cong S_n/S_\alpha\) where \(S_{\alpha}\) is the stabilizer of \(\alpha^*\). Denote \(\alpha!=|S_{\alpha}|=\prod_{i}\alpha_i!\)</p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. The <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(S_n/S_\alpha\) is the transitive closure (they are connected by relations of the following kind) of \(B&lt;(i\ j)B\) for \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\) where \(i\in B_a\) and \(j\in B_b\) and \(a&lt;b\) and \(i&lt;j\).</p></blockquote><p>We note that the <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(S_n/S_{(1,\dots,1)}\) is just the usual Bruhat order on \(S_n\). For \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\) let \(\operatorname{word}(B)\) be the permutation by concatonating the numbers in each set written in their usual order. This sends ordered set partitions to a more common definition: \(\sigma\in S_n\) where \(\sigma(i)&gt;\sigma(i+1)\) implies \(i\in S(\alpha)\), and Bruhat order restricted to such permutations. There is an obvious bijection \((S_n/S_\alpha)\times S_\alpha\rightarrow S_n\) by \((B,\sigma)\mapsto \operatorname{word}(B)\sigma\). The \(\alpha\)-Bruhat order \(\le_{\alpha}\) on \(S_n\) is the image of \((B,\sigma)\le (B^\prime,\sigma^\prime)\) iff \(\sigma=\sigma^\prime\) and \(B\le B^\prime\) in Bruhat order under the aforementioned bijection, which is isomorphic to \(\alpha!\) isomorphic copies of \(S_n/S_\alpha\). If \(w\in\mathbf R^n\), define \(\operatorname{comp}(w)\vdash n\) as the composition of lengths of the weekly increasing components.

&lt;p&gt;This week is the first week of the spring term and also my first week of undergraduate research with Prof. Satriano, so I decided to write about a research paper I’ve given to read, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08535.pdf&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \(\sigma\in S_n\) acts on \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) by permutation, and let \(\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\{\sigma\in S_n: w\cdot \sigma v=0\}\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \(\sum_ix_i=0\), where \(n\ge 3\). In notations, we have the following theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

Bloch </p></blockquote><p>In this week we discuss fppf sites (recall that we defined \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\) in last week) and faithfully flat descent. This will help us to build our way to the definition of a stack. The idea of faifully flat descent is that a certain property of schemes can be descended via a cartesian square with a fppf side. The important result we are building towards is that for any scheme \(X\), the functor of points \(\mathscr{H}_X\) is a sheaf on the fppf site of \(X\). After this, we can talk about fibred categories. Fibred categories plus descents is categorical stacks, plus geometry is algebraic stacks.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Fppf-site-and-faithfully-flat-descent"><a href="#Fppf-site-and-faithfully-flat-descent" class="headerlink" title="Fppf site and faithfully flat descent"></a>Fppf site and faithfully flat descent</h4><p>We recall that a map of schemes is fppf iff it is faithfully flat (i.e. flat and surjective) and locally of finite presentation, and recall that the fppf site \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\) consists of the fppf covers, i.e. the jointly surjective, flat and locally of finite presentation families of morphisms. We have the following problem.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 1.

Another important result is faithfully flat descent. The idea is, if \(P\) is some property of morphism of schemes, given morphisms of schemes \(f_1:X_1\rightarrow Y_1\) and \(f_2:X_2\rightarrow Y_2\) and suppose there is a commutative diagram <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJYXzEiXSxbMSwwLCJZXzEiXSxbMCwxLCJYXzIiXSxbMSwxLCJZXzIiXSxbMCwxLCJmXzEiXSxbMiwzLCJmXzIiXSxbMCwyLCJcXG1hdGhybXtmcHBmfSIsMix7InN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6ImVwaSJ9fX1dLFsxLDNdXQ==&embed" width="184" height="184" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important; border: none;border-radius: 0px;"></iframe></div> </p><p>then frequently \(f_1\) has property \(P\) iff \(f_2\) does. We say that \(P\) is local on the base (target) for the fppf topology (et al. Zariski, etc.) if \(f_1\) has property \(P\) implies \(f_2\) does. Examples of properties that are local on the base for the fppf topology inlcude: surjective, locally of finite type, locally of finite presentation, universally closed/open, separated, proper, etc. The full proof can be found on <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02YJ">stacks project</a>.</p><h4 id="Fibred-categories"><a href="#Fibred-categories" class="headerlink" title="Fibred categories"></a>Fibred categories</h4><p>For a category \(\mathcal C\), a category over \(\mathcal C\) is some category \(\mathcal F\) equipped with a functor \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal C\). We draw diagrams with the notation \(\xi\mapsto U\) to mean \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)=U\), and a diagram of the form  <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJcXHhpIl0sWzEsMCwiXFxldGEiXSxbMCwxLCJVIl0sWzEsMSwiViJdLFswLDEsIlxccGhpIl0sWzIsMywiZiJdLFswLDIsIiIsMSx7InN0eWxlIjp7InRhaWwiOnsibmFtZSI6Im1hcHMgdG8ifX19XSxbMSwzLCIiLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJ0YWlsIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJtYXBzIHRvIn19fV1d&embed" width="184" height="184" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important; border: none;border-radius: 0px;"></iframe></div> </p><p>commutes iff \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi=f\).

This diagram is sometimes known as the “universal property” of cartesian morphisms. Note that given two pullbacks \(\phi_1:\xi_1\rightarrow\eta\) and \(\phi_2:\xi_2\rightarrow\eta\) then substitute \(\psi=\xi_i\) for \(i=1,2\) will give us an isomorphism \(\xi_1\cong\xi_2\). Thus, pullbacks are unique up to a unique isomorphism. Note that in SGA1 the definition of cartesian arrow is different and this definition is sometimes known as strongly cartesian. Next, we introduce the following properties, which is easy to check,</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 2. Let \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal C\) be a category over the category \(\mathcal C\).</p><ol><li>composite of cartesian arrows are cartesian,</li><li>if \(\psi:\eta\rightarrow \zeta\) and \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) are arrows in \(\mathcal F\) with \(\psi\) cartesian, then \(\phi\) is cartesian iff \(\psi\circ\phi\) is,</li><li>if \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) is an arrow and \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi\) is an isomorphism, then \(\phi\) is cartesian iff it is an isomorphism,</li></ol></blockquote><p>With these knowledge, we can introduce fibred categories. Fibred categories are used to provide a general framework for descent theory. They formalize various situations in geometry and algebra where pullbacks of objects are defined. A motivating example is the category of vector bundles on a topological space.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. </p><ol><li>A <em>fibred category</em> over a category \(\mathcal C\) is a category \(\mathcal F\) over \(\mathcal C\) such that for each \(f:U\rightarrow V\) in \(\mathcal C\) where \(V=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\eta)\) for some \(\eta\in \mathcal F\), there exists \(\xi\in\mathcal F\) with \(U=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)\) and cartesian arrow \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) such that \(f=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi\).</li><li>Suppose \(\mathcal F,\mathcal G\) are fibred categories over \(\mathcal C\), then a <em>morphism of fibred categories</em> \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow \mathcal G\) is a functor such that \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal G}\circ \mathscr{F}=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\) and \(\mathscr{F}\) sends cartesian arrows to cartesian arrows. </li><li>Suppose \(\mathcal F\) is a category over \(\mathcal C\) and \(U\in\mathcal C\), write \(\mathcal F(U)\) as the subcategory of \(\mathcal F\) whose objects are \(\xi\in\mathcal F\) such that \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)=U\) and morphisms are \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow \eta\) where \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi=\mathbf{1}_U\).</li><li>If \(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{G}:\mathcal F\rightarrow \mathcal G\) are morphisms of fibred categories, a <em>base-preserving natural transformation</em> \(\alpha:\mathscr{F}\rightarrow \mathscr{G}\) is a natural transformation such that for all \(u\in\mathcal F\) we have \(\alpha(u):\mathscr{F}(u)\rightarrow \mathscr{G}(u)\) is such that \(\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u))=\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{G}(u))\) and \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal G}\alpha(u)=\mathbf 1_{\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u))}\), i.e. \(\alpha(u)\) is a morphism in \(\mathcal G(\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u)))\). </li><li>Denote by \(\mathrm{MOR}_{\mathcal C}(\mathcal F,\mathcal G)\) the category whose objects are morphisms of fibred categories and morphisms are base-preserving natural transformations.</li><li>For a morphism of fibred categories \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal G\) over \(\mathcal C\) and \(U\in\mathcal C\), we write \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) to denote the functor where \(\mathscr{F}_U(\xi)=\mathscr{F}(\xi)\) and \(\mathscr{F}_U\phi=\mathscr{F}\phi\).</li></ol></blockquote><p>Thus in a fibred category we can pullback objects along any arrow. For example, for a category \(\mathcal C\) with \(X\in\mathcal C\), we have \(\mathcal C/X\) is fibred over \(\mathcal C\) via \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal C/X}:\mathcal C/X\rightarrow \mathcal C\) given by \((Y\rightarrow X)\mapsto Y\) and morphisms are mapped to themsleves. It should be easy to check that this is well-defined.</p><p>Why do we need fibred categories? Suppose \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) is a morphism of schemes. For any morphism of schemes \(t:T\rightarrow Y\) we can form a fibred product \(T\times_Y X\) which is only unique up to a unique isomorphism. Thus implicitly there is a choice being made. This becomes a technical obstacle in developing the theory of stacks, and fibred categories are used to address this problem. For more detail, see Example 3.1.5 in Olsson’s book. </p><p>The collection of categories fibred over a fixed category is an example of a \(2\)-category. Roughly speaking, a \(2\)-category is a category where the morphisms between two objects form a category. However, we will not use higher categorical language. </p><blockquote><p>Lemma 4. Let \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal G\) be a morphism of fibred categories over \(\mathcal C\), </p><ol><li>\(\mathscr{F}\) is fully faithful (as a functor) iff \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) is fully faithful for all \(U\in\mathcal C\),</li><li>\(\mathscr{F}\) is an equivalence (of categories) iff \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) is an equivalence for all \(U\in\mathcal C\).</li></ol><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Lemma 3.1.8, Olsson.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>Recall the classical Yoneda lemma: for each object \(A\in\mathcal C\) we have a natural isomorphism between the collection of natural transformations \(\mathrm{Nat}(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{H}^A)\), and the set \(\mathscr{F}(A)\). This point of view is crucial for the development of algebraic spaces, and also for fibred categories we need a variant of this lemma.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 5 (\(2\)-Yoneda lemma). Suppose \(\mathcal F\) is fibred over \(\mathcal C\), there is an equivalence<br>\[\mathrm{MOR}_{\mathcal C}(\mathcal C/X,\mathcal F)\cong \mathcal F(X)\]given by \(\mathscr{F}\mapsto \mathscr{F}(\mathbf 1_{X})\).</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Proposition 3.2.2 Olsson.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>It is often useful to think of a fibred category as the collection of categories \(\mathcal{F}(U)\) with a pullback functor. Thus, we introduce split fibred categories. We will not go over the details of the rigorous definition, but the reader can check 3.3.1 in Olsson’s book.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

In the end of this semaster hopefully I will have written enough about them in this blog so that I can compile them into actual typesetted notes. We start by revisiting étale morphisms and introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Then, we will define important sites such as the big and small Zariski sites and étale sites as well as the fppf site. </p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Etale-morphisms-of-schemes"><a href="#Etale-morphisms-of-schemes" class="headerlink" title="Étale morphisms of schemes"></a>Étale morphisms of schemes</h4><p>First, we revisit the definitions and properties of étale morphisms of schemes. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A morphism of schemes \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) is <em>étale</em> if one of these equivalent conditions holds</p><ol><li>\(f\) is smooth and locally quasi-finite,</li><li>\(f\) is smooth and unramified,</li><li>\(f\) is flat and unramified,</li><li>\(f\) is locally of finite presentation and formally étale</li><li>\(f\) is locally of finite presentation and locally a standard étale morphism,</li></ol></blockquote><p>There are many more equivalent definitions of étale morphisms listed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tale_morphism">wikipedia</a>. Intuitively, I think of étale morphisms analogous to covering maps. We need this notion to define the étale topology which we will need to use later. As a side note, there is also something called the étale fundamental group, which also uses the notion of étale morphisms. We recall these properties of étale morphisms.</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 4. </p><ol><li>compotision of étale maps are étale,</li><li>if \(f:Y\rightarrow X\) is étale then its base change \(Y\times_XZ\rightarrow Z\) is étale,</li><li>if \(f:Y\rightarrow X\) and \(g:Z\rightarrow X\) are étale and \(g=f\circ h\) where \(h:Z\rightarrow Y\), then \(h\) is étale</li><li>given algebraically closed field \(k\) and \(k\)-algebra \(A\), then the morphism \(\mathrm{Spec}(A)\rightarrow\mathrm{Spec}(k)\) is étale iff it is the disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of \(k\).</li></ol></blockquote><p>Now, we are ready to define Grothendieck topology and sites.</p><h4 id="Grothendieck-topology-sites-and-topoi"><a href="#Grothendieck-topology-sites-and-topoi" class="headerlink" title="Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi"></a>Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi</h4><p>Recall that a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space \(X\) is a contravariant functor \(\mathscr{F}:\mathrm{Op}(X)\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}\), and a presheaf is a sheaf when \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\cap U_j)\) is an equalizer for every open cover \(\{U_{i}\}\) of any open \(U\subseteq X\), which is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms. We want to extend this from \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) to any category \(\mathcal C\). To do this, we need to add some additional structure on the category \(\mathcal C\) so that its objects can be viewed as “open sets” and morphisms can be viewed as “inclusions”. Grothendieck’s insight is that we don’t need the full strength of a topology to define sheaves, we only need intersections and a notion of when a collection of an open set forms an open cover of it. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 1. A <em>Grothendieck topology</em> on a category \(\mathcal C\) is the data of a set of <em>coverings</em> of \(U\), written as \(\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), for each object \(U\in \mathcal C\), where each covering \(S\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) is a set of morphisms of \(\mathcal C\) with \(U\) as targets, such that for all \(U\in\mathcal C\)</p><ol><li>for each isomorphism \(\varphi:V\rightarrow U\), we have \(\{\varphi\}\in \mathrm{Cov}(U)\)</li><li>if \(\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) and \(\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow V_i\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(V_i)\) for each \(i\), then \(\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\)</li><li>for \(\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) and \(W\rightarrow U\), all \(W\times_UV_i\) exists and \(\{W\times_UV_i\rightarrow W\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(W)\)</li></ol><p>A category \(\mathcal C\) equipped with a choice of Grothendieck topology, also denoted \(\mathcal C\), is a <em>site</em>. A continuous functor between sites \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal D\) is a functor between their underlying categories such that for all \(\{X_i\rightarrow X\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal C}(X)\) we have \(\{f(X_i)\rightarrow f(X)\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal D}(f(X))\), and it commutes with finite fibred products if they exist.</p></blockquote><p>For example, \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) for a topological space \(X\) can be made into a site using the usual notion of covering. We note that in \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) we have the fibered product \(U\times_X V=U\cap V\) for all open \(U,V\subseteq X\), which agrees with the usual notion of intersection. For a category \(\mathcal C\) with \(X\in\mathcal C\), the category of objects over \(X\), denoted \(\mathcal C/X\) is the category where objects are morphisms \(Y\rightarrow X\) in \(\mathcal C\) and morphisms between \(Y_1\rightarrow X\) and \(Y_2\rightarrow X\) are all morphisms \(Y_1\rightarrow Y_2\) in \(\mathcal C\) such that the obvious triangle commutes, i.e. \((Y_1\rightarrow Y_2\rightarrow X)=Y_1\rightarrow X\). If \(\mathcal C\) is a site, then \(\mathcal C/X\) can be given a site structure, by letting \(\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)\) in \(\mathcal C/X\) be \(\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) in \(\mathcal C\). The site \(\mathcal C/X\) is called the <em>localization</em> of the site \(\mathcal C\) at \(X\). Suppose \(X\) is a scheme, then we say that the <em>big Zariski (resp. big étale, resp. fppf) site</em>, denoted \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{Zar}}\) (resp. \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{ét}}\), resp. \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\)) of \(X\), is the site with the category \(\mathbf{Sch}/X\) and \(\{Y_i\rightarrow Y\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) iff each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is an open immersion with \(Y=\bigcup_i Y_i\) (resp. each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is étale with \(\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y\) surjective, resp. each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is flat and locally of finite presentation with \(\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y\) surjective). An element of \(\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)\) is called a <em>Zariski cover</em> (resp. <em>étale cover</em>, resp. <em>fppf cover</em>) of \(U\). The small Zariski site (resp. small étale site) of \(X\), denoted \(X_{\mathrm{Zar}}\) (resp. \(X_{\mathrm{ét}}\)) is the site whose category is the full subcategory of \(\mathrm{Sch}/X\) where each object \(U\rightarrow X\) is an open immersion (resp. étale), and the coverings are the same as the big Zariski (resp. big étale) site. The small Zariski site of \(X\) is equivalent to the site \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\). Moreover, we have the following inclusions<br>\[\{\mathrm{Zariski\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{étale\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{fppf\ cover}\}\]Next, we discuss presheaves and sheaves on a site. This whole business is to get new cohomology theories such as étale cohomology, because basic sheaf cohomology is insufficient for our needs.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. A <em>presheaf</em> (of sets) on a site \(\mathcal C\) is a contravariant functor \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}\), and a presheaf is a <em>sheaf</em> iff \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\times_U U_j)\) is an equalizer for all \(U\in\mathcal C\) and \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\). A presheaf is called <em>separated</em> if for all \(U\in\mathcal C\) and \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), the map \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)\) is injective. We write \(\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) (resp. \(\mathrm{PSh}(\mathcal C)\)) for the category of sheaves (resp. presheaves) of the site \(\mathcal C\).</p></blockquote><p>Note that a separated presheaf can be viewed as a presheaf that only satisfies one of the axioms of a sheaf, the identity axiom, but not necessaily the gluability axiom, therefore we have the obvious inclusions<br>\[\{\mathrm{sheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{separated\ presheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{presheaves}\}\]all of which admits left adjoints, the composition of them being sheafification. Usually, we can formulate sheafification in terms of compatible germs, but since we are working over sites, it does not make sense to take a point in an object and take the product of stalks. The way we construct the adjoint from presheaves to separated presheaves is to map a presheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) to \(\mathscr{F}^{\mathrm s}(U)=\mathscr{F}(U)/\sim\) where \(a\sim b\) iff exists \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) such that \(a,b\) are mapped to the same element by the map \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)\). We can check that this is in fact a separated presheaf. All of the above works for (pre)sheaves of rings, abelian groups, etc.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A <em>topos</em> is a category equivalent to \(\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) for a site \(\mathcal C\). A morphism of topoi \(f:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2\) is an adjoint pair \(f^*\dashv f_*\) of functors \(f^*:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2\) and \(f_*:\mathcal{T}_2\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_1\) with a choice of natural isomorphism<br>\[\Phi:\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_1}(f^*(-),-)\rightarrow \mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_2}(-,f_*(-))\]where each naturality here means \(\Phi\) is natural in each of the two dashes, and \(f^*\) commutes with finite limits when they exist. Define composition in the obvious way.</p></blockquote><p>We remark that in the above definition, commuting with finite limits is equivalent to checking that \(f^*\) commutes with finite products and preserve equalizers. In many cases, though not always, a continuous functor between sites \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D\) induces a functor \(f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) by \(f_*(\mathscr{F})(X)=\mathscr{F}(f(X))\), where the well-definedness follows from \(\mathscr{F}(f(U_i\times_U U_j))=\mathscr{F}(f(U_i)\times_{f(U)} f(U_j))\) for any \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), as illustrated by the diagram <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=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&embed" width="545" height="182" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important;"></iframe></div><br>This induced functor does not always admit a left adjoint.

If \(\mathcal C,\mathcal D\) are sites with small underlying categories, then the functor \(f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) induced by a continuous functor \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D\) admits a left adjoint \(f^*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\). If, further, that finite limits in \(\mathcal C\) are representable and \(f\) commutes with them, then \(f^*\) commutes with finite limits. </p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>We construct this functor concretely. For each \(U\in\mathcal D\), let \(\mathcal I_U\) be the category where objects are pairs \(\langle V,\rho\rangle\) where \(V\in\mathcal C\) and \(\rho\in \mathrm{Mor}_\mathcal{D}(U,f(V))\), and a morphism \(g:\langle V_1,\rho_1\rangle \rightarrow \langle V_2,\rho_2\rangle\) is a morphism \(g:V_1\rightarrow V_2\) in \(\mathcal C\) such that \((fg)\circ\rho_1=\rho_2\). We define\[f^*(\mathscr{F})(U)=\lim_{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\langle V,\rho\rangle\in\mathcal I_{U}^\mathrm{op}}}\mathscr{F}(V)\]and for each \(h:U_1\rightarrow U_2\) in \(\mathcal C\), there is functor \(\mathcal I_{U_2}\rightarrow \mathcal I_{U_1}\) given by \(\langle V,\rho\rangle\mapsto \langle V,\rho\circ h\rangle\) which induces a morphism \(f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_2)\rightarrow f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_1)\).

&lt;p&gt;This week I plan to start writing about what I’ve learned in PMATH 965 on algebraic stacks. In the end of this semaster hopefully I will have written enough about them in this blog so that I can compile them into actual typesetted notes. We start by revisiting étale morphisms and introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Then, we will define important sites such as the big and small Zariski sites and étale sites as well as the fppf site. &lt;/p&gt;

My project is called “Galois cohomology and weak Mordell–Weil theorem”, which is available <a href="/documents/Galois_Cohomology.pdf">here</a>. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \(k\) with an algebraic closure \(K\), the Galois group \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit of topological Galois groups \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \(L/k\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \(G\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \(G\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology  where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \(G\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation. </p><span id="more"></span><p>My final project focuses on the proof of the weak Mordell–Weil theorem, which states that for any elliptic curve \(E\), the group \(E(k)/nE(k)\) is finite for all \(n\ge 2\). This is an important step in the proof of the Mordell–Weil theorem which states the elliptic curve groups are finitely generated. The proof of Mordell–Weil involves in applying an infinite descent argument to weak Mordell–Weil, which I will not go into detail. The motivating observation is that we have an exact sequence of topological \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\)-modules \[\mathbf{0}\rightarrow E(K)[n]\rightarrow E(K)\xrightarrow{n}E(K)\rightarrow\mathbf{0}\]This short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which we truncate after the first cohomology groups. The first cohomology group can be viewed as the group of crossed homomorphisms module the principal crossed homomorphisms, where a crossed homomorphism is some \(f\) with \(f(gh)=gf(h)+f(g)\) for all \(g,h\) and a principal crossed homomorphism is a homomorphism where there exists \(m\) with \(f(g)=gm-m\) for all \(g\). This can be verified by just computing out the differential. Next, we define the \(n\)-Selmer groups and the Tate-Shafarevich group, which is applied to the induced exact sequence we just found in order to obtain a better bound for the group \(E(k)/nE(k)\). Finally, the finiteness of \(E(k)/nE(k)\) is obtained from the finiteness of the Selmer groups.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>
