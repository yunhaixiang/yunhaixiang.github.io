    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“If only we could actually learn math by physically bashing our heads with textbooks, it might be easier than the alternative.” </p><p style="text-align: right;"> <em>A friend of mine</em> </p></blockquote><p>This week I finally finished my final project for my PMATH 499 reading course in arithmetic geometry. My project is called “Galois cohomology and weak Mordell-Weil theorem”, which is available <a href="/documents/Galois_Cohomology.pdf">here</a>. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \(k\) with an algebraic closure \(K\), the Galois group \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit \(\displaystyle\lim_{\longleftarrow}\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \(L/k\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \(G\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \(G\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology  where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \(G\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Project Sigma is a collection of my personal course notes on various mathematical topics, titled <em>The Egregium</em>. I decided to start this project primarily as a motivation for myself to learn and as a way of recording my learning progress. That being said, it would also make me very happy if someone else benefits from my work. Each of the subject will have their own GitHub repository, typically named as “Project-Sigma-XXX” where XXX is an abbriviation of the subject. They will probably contain errors, and if you found one, you are welcomed to open an issue page on the respective repository and point out my mistake. Currently, the following subjects are planned.</p><span id="more"></span><table>  <tr>    <th>Subject</th>    <th>Repository</th>    <th>Release</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Algebraic Geometry</td>    <td><a href="https://github.com/YunhaiXiang/Project-Sigma-ALG">Project-Sigma-ALG</a></td>    <td>Incomplete</td>  </tr></table><p>I also plan to add new subjects in the future, but only after the current ones are almost completed. To download, either click the link under the <strong>Release</strong> tab or go to the corresponding repository and clone the repository directly. When writing these notes, I will try to adhere to the following philosophies:</p><ul><li>Consistent and unambiguous notation: this means that I will follow the same notation conventions for all of the course notes and exercises. I will also clearly state any abuse of notation I will use.</li><li>Sketches of proof: this means that I will provide bullet points of my reasoning for many of the exercises and theorems instead of providing full proofs. I will try to make them as perspicuous and coherent as I can.</li><li>Prototypical examples: this means that I will give quintessential examples and non-examples for important notions. Examples help myself to build intuitions for abstract concepts.</li></ul><p>Finally, note that this project is licensed under <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Common BY-NC 4.0</a>, which means that you are free to share or adapt these documents for non-commercial purposes if you give appropriate credit.
