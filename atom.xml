Sylvester </p></blockquote><p>This week is the first week of the spring term and also my first week of undergraduate research with Prof. Satriano, so I decided to write about a research paper I’ve given to read, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08535.pdf">this one</a>. In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \(\sigma\in S_n\) acts on \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) by permutation, and let \(\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\{\sigma\in S_n: w\cdot \sigma v=0\}\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \(\sum_ix_i=0\), where \(n\ge 3\). In notations, we have the following theorem.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Theorem 1. For \(n\ge 3\), we have<br>\[\max\{|\mathcal{O}(v,w)|: v\in S,w\in\mathbf{R}^n\}=2\lfloor n/2\rfloor (n-2)!\]where \(S=\{v\in \mathbf R^n: v\cdot \mathbf{1}\ne 0, v\mathrm{\ has\ distinct\ coordinates}\}\).</p></blockquote><p>An explicit construction that achieves this bound is given by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, so it suffice to show that this is the best bound. The proof uses Bruhat order and Sperner property. </p><h4 id="Bruhat-order"><a href="#Bruhat-order" class="headerlink" title="Bruhat order"></a>Bruhat order</h4><p>Suppose \(\alpha\vdash n\) with \(\ell(\alpha)=m\), and \(i_j=\sum_{k=1}^j\alpha_j\) for \(j=0,1\dots,m\). Let \(X_{\alpha}\) be the set of ordered set partitions of type \(\alpha\). Naturally, we have \(\alpha^*\in X_{\alpha}\) where \(\alpha^*_j=\{i_j+1,i_j+2,\dots,i_{j+1}\}\). Let \(S(\alpha)=\{i_1,\dots,i_{m-1}\}\). We have \(S_n\) acts on \(X_{\alpha}\) by element, which is a transitive action. Thus identify \(X_{\alpha}\cong S_n/S_\alpha\) where \(S_{\alpha}\) is the stabilizer of \(\alpha^*\). Denote \(\alpha!=|S_{\alpha}|=\prod_{i}\alpha_i!\)</p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. The <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(S_n/S_\alpha\) is the transitive closure (they are connected by relations of the following kind) of \(B&lt;(i\ j)B\) for \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\) where \(i\in B_a\) and \(j\in B_b\) and \(a&lt;b\) and \(i&lt;j\).</p></blockquote><p>We note that the <em>Bruhat order</em> on \(S_n/S_{(1,\dots,1)}\) is just the usual Bruhat order on \(S_n\). For \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\) let \(\operatorname{word}(B)\) be the permutation by concatonating the numbers in each set written in their usual order. This sends ordered set partitions to a more common definition: \(\sigma\in S_n\) where \(\sigma(i)&gt;\sigma(i+1)\) implies \(i\in S(\alpha)\), and Bruhat order restricted to such permutations. There is an obvious bijection \((S_n/S_\alpha)\times S_\alpha\rightarrow S_n\) by \((B,\sigma)\mapsto \operatorname{word}(B)\sigma\). The \(\alpha\)-Bruhat order \(\le_{\alpha}\) on \(S_n\) is the image of \((B,\sigma)\le (B^\prime,\sigma^\prime)\) iff \(\sigma=\sigma^\prime\) and \(B\le B^\prime\) in Bruhat order under the aforementioned bijection, which is isomorphic to \(\alpha!\) isomorphic copies of \(S_n/S_\alpha\). If \(w\in\mathbf R^n\), define \(\operatorname{comp}(w)\vdash n\) as the composition of lengths of the weekly increasing components. An antichain in a poset is a set consisting of elements from different disjoint components.</p><blockquote><p>Lemma 3. Suppose \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) is stricly increasing and \(w\in\mathbf R^n\) weakly increasing, then \(\mathcal O(v,w)\) is an antichain in the \(\alpha\)-Bruhat order where \(\alpha=\operatorname{comp}(w)\).</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Suppose \(\pi\in S_{\alpha}\) and \(\tau=\operatorname{word}(B)\) for some \(B\in S_n/S_\alpha\). Suppose \(i\in B_a\) and \(j\in B_b\) for \(i&lt;j\) and \(a&lt;b\). We have \(\tau \pi&lt; (i\ j)\tau \pi\). Next, we compute that<br>\[w\cdot \tau\pi v-w\cdot (i\ j)\tau \pi v=(w_j-w_i)(v_{\pi^{-1}\tau^{-1}(j)}-v_{\pi^{-1}\tau^{-1}(i)})\]Since \(\tau^{-1}(i)\) is at a lower interval than \(\tau^{-1}(j)\) (since \(a&lt;b\)) and \(\pi^{-1}\) preserves these intervals, we have \(v_{\pi^{-1}\tau^{-1}(j)}&gt;v_{\pi^{-1}\tau^{-1}(i)}\). Since we have \(w_i&lt;w_j\) by assumption, we have \(w\cdot \tau\pi v&gt;w\cdot (i\ j)\tau \pi v\). Therefore, if \(\sigma&lt;_{\alpha}\sigma^\prime\) then \(w\cdot \sigma v&gt;w\cdot \sigma^\prime v\).</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>Therefore, we can bound the sizes of antichains in the \(\alpha\)-Bruhat order.</p><h4 id="Sperner-property"><a href="#Sperner-property" class="headerlink" title="Sperner property"></a>Sperner property</h4><p>We use \(q\)-polynomials to bound the sizes of antichains. Specifically, we will make use of the Sperner property of \(S_n/S_\alpha\): it is a ranked poset where the set of elements of rank \(r\), for some fixed \(r\), forms an antichain of maximal size. The rank generating function of \(S_n/S_\alpha\) is the \(q\)-binomial coefficient \(\begin{bmatrix}n\\ \alpha\end{bmatrix}_q\).</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 4. Let \(v,w\in\mathbf R^n\) where \(v\) has distinct coordinates, then<br>\[|\mathcal{O}(v,w)|\le \alpha!M\left(\begin{bmatrix}n\\ \alpha\end{bmatrix}_q\right)\]where \(\alpha=\operatorname{comp}(w)\) and \(M:\mathbf{Z}[q]\rightarrow\mathbf Z\) is the map that takes the maximum coefficient.</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Since \(|\mathcal{O}(v,w)|=|\mathcal{O}(\sigma v,\tau w)|\) for any \(\sigma,\tau\in S^n\), we can assume \(v\) is strictly increasing and \(w\) weakly increasing. By the previous lemma, we have \(\mathcal{O}(v,w)\) is an antichain in the \(\alpha\)-Bruhat order on \(S_n\), and hence also on \(S_n/S_\alpha\times S_\alpha\). By the Sperner property, we have this bound.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>Therefore, it suffice to bound the coefficients of \(\begin{bmatrix}n\\ \alpha\end{bmatrix}_q\). </p><h4 id="Bounding-coefficients"><a href="#Bounding-coefficients" class="headerlink" title="Bounding coefficients"></a>Bounding coefficients</h4><p>Given \(\alpha,\beta\vdash n\), then we say \(\beta\) refines \(\alpha\), written as \(\alpha\prec \beta\), if \(\beta\) is obtained from \(\alpha\) by decomposing its entries.</p><blockquote><p>Lemma 5. If \(\alpha,\beta\vdash n\) and \(\alpha\prec \beta\), then \(\beta !M\left(\begin{bmatrix}n\\ \beta\end{bmatrix}_q\right)\le \alpha!

Bloch </p></blockquote><p>In this week we discuss fppf sites (recall that we defined \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\) in last week) and faithfully flat descent. This will help us to build our way to the definition of a stack. The idea of faifully flat descent is that a certain property of schemes can be descended via a cartesian square with a fppf side. The important result we are building towards is that for any scheme \(X\), the functor of points \(\mathscr{H}_X\) is a sheaf on the fppf site of \(X\). After this, we can talk about fibred categories. Fibred categories plus descents is categorical stacks, plus geometry is algebraic stacks.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Fppf-site-and-faithfully-flat-descent"><a href="#Fppf-site-and-faithfully-flat-descent" class="headerlink" title="Fppf site and faithfully flat descent"></a>Fppf site and faithfully flat descent</h4><p>We recall that a map of schemes is fppf iff it is faithfully flat (i.e. flat and surjective) and locally of finite presentation, and recall that the fppf site \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\) consists of the fppf covers, i.e. the jointly surjective, flat and locally of finite presentation families of morphisms. We have the following problem.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 1. Suppose \(X\rightarrow Y\) is a morphism of schemes, the functor of points \(\mathscr{H}_X\) is a sheaf on \((\mathbf{Sch}/Y)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\).</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Proof is very long, see Theorem 4.1.2 in Olsson’s book.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>This theorem has a very long proof and the reason it is important is delayed to later. Another important result is faithfully flat descent. The idea is, if \(P\) is some property of morphism of schemes, given morphisms of schemes \(f_1:X_1\rightarrow Y_1\) and \(f_2:X_2\rightarrow Y_2\) and suppose there is a commutative diagram <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJYXzEiXSxbMSwwLCJZXzEiXSxbMCwxLCJYXzIiXSxbMSwxLCJZXzIiXSxbMCwxLCJmXzEiXSxbMiwzLCJmXzIiXSxbMCwyLCJcXG1hdGhybXtmcHBmfSIsMix7InN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6ImVwaSJ9fX1dLFsxLDNdXQ==&embed" width="184" height="184" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important; border: none;border-radius: 0px;"></iframe></div> </p><p>then frequently \(f_1\) has property \(P\) iff \(f_2\) does. We say that \(P\) is local on the base (target) for the fppf topology (et al. Zariski, etc.) if \(f_1\) has property \(P\) implies \(f_2\) does. Examples of properties that are local on the base for the fppf topology inlcude: surjective, locally of finite type, locally of finite presentation, universally closed/open, separated, proper, etc. The full proof can be found on <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02YJ">stacks project</a>.</p><h4 id="Fibred-categories"><a href="#Fibred-categories" class="headerlink" title="Fibred categories"></a>Fibred categories</h4><p>For a category \(\mathcal C\), a category over \(\mathcal C\) is some category \(\mathcal F\) equipped with a functor \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal C\). We draw diagrams with the notation \(\xi\mapsto U\) to mean \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)=U\), and a diagram of the form  <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJcXHhpIl0sWzEsMCwiXFxldGEiXSxbMCwxLCJVIl0sWzEsMSwiViJdLFswLDEsIlxccGhpIl0sWzIsMywiZiJdLFswLDIsIiIsMSx7InN0eWxlIjp7InRhaWwiOnsibmFtZSI6Im1hcHMgdG8ifX19XSxbMSwzLCIiLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJ0YWlsIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJtYXBzIHRvIn19fV1d&embed" width="184" height="184" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important; border: none;border-radius: 0px;"></iframe></div> </p><p>commutes iff \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi=f\).

This diagram is sometimes known as the “universal property” of cartesian morphisms. Note that given two pullbacks \(\phi_1:\xi_1\rightarrow\eta\) and \(\phi_2:\xi_2\rightarrow\eta\) then substitute \(\psi=\xi_i\) for \(i=1,2\) will give us an isomorphism \(\xi_1\cong\xi_2\). Thus, pullbacks are unique up to a unique isomorphism. Note that in SGA1 the definition of cartesian arrow is different and this definition is sometimes known as strongly cartesian. Next, we introduce the following properties, which is easy to check,</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 2. Let \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal C\) be a category over the category \(\mathcal C\).</p><ol><li>composite of cartesian arrows are cartesian,</li><li>if \(\psi:\eta\rightarrow \zeta\) and \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) are arrows in \(\mathcal F\) with \(\psi\) cartesian, then \(\phi\) is cartesian iff \(\psi\circ\phi\) is,</li><li>if \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) is an arrow and \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi\) is an isomorphism, then \(\phi\) is cartesian iff it is an isomorphism,</li></ol></blockquote><p>With these knowledge, we can introduce fibred categories. Fibred categories are used to provide a general framework for descent theory. They formalize various situations in geometry and algebra where pullbacks of objects are defined. A motivating example is the category of vector bundles on a topological space.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. </p><ol><li>A <em>fibred category</em> over a category \(\mathcal C\) is a category \(\mathcal F\) over \(\mathcal C\) such that for each \(f:U\rightarrow V\) in \(\mathcal C\) where \(V=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\eta)\) for some \(\eta\in \mathcal F\), there exists \(\xi\in\mathcal F\) with \(U=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)\) and cartesian arrow \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow\eta\) such that \(f=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi\).</li><li>Suppose \(\mathcal F,\mathcal G\) are fibred categories over \(\mathcal C\), then a <em>morphism of fibred categories</em> \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow \mathcal G\) is a functor such that \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal G}\circ \mathscr{F}=\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\) and \(\mathscr{F}\) sends cartesian arrows to cartesian arrows. </li><li>Suppose \(\mathcal F\) is a category over \(\mathcal C\) and \(U\in\mathcal C\), write \(\mathcal F(U)\) as the subcategory of \(\mathcal F\) whose objects are \(\xi\in\mathcal F\) such that \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}(\xi)=U\) and morphisms are \(\phi:\xi\rightarrow \eta\) where \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal F}\phi=\mathbf{1}_U\).</li><li>If \(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{G}:\mathcal F\rightarrow \mathcal G\) are morphisms of fibred categories, a <em>base-preserving natural transformation</em> \(\alpha:\mathscr{F}\rightarrow \mathscr{G}\) is a natural transformation such that for all \(u\in\mathcal F\) we have \(\alpha(u):\mathscr{F}(u)\rightarrow \mathscr{G}(u)\) is such that \(\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u))=\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{G}(u))\) and \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal G}\alpha(u)=\mathbf 1_{\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u))}\), i.e. \(\alpha(u)\) is a morphism in \(\mathcal G(\mathscr{P}_\mathcal{G}(\mathscr{F}(u)))\). </li><li>Denote by \(\mathrm{MOR}_{\mathcal C}(\mathcal F,\mathcal G)\) the category whose objects are morphisms of fibred categories and morphisms are base-preserving natural transformations.</li><li>For a morphism of fibred categories \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal G\) over \(\mathcal C\) and \(U\in\mathcal C\), we write \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) to denote the functor where \(\mathscr{F}_U(\xi)=\mathscr{F}(\xi)\) and \(\mathscr{F}_U\phi=\mathscr{F}\phi\).</li></ol></blockquote><p>Thus in a fibred category we can pullback objects along any arrow. For example, for a category \(\mathcal C\) with \(X\in\mathcal C\), we have \(\mathcal C/X\) is fibred over \(\mathcal C\) via \(\mathscr{P}_{\mathcal C/X}:\mathcal C/X\rightarrow \mathcal C\) given by \((Y\rightarrow X)\mapsto Y\) and morphisms are mapped to themsleves. It should be easy to check that this is well-defined.</p><p>Why do we need fibred categories? Suppose \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) is a morphism of schemes. For any morphism of schemes \(t:T\rightarrow Y\) we can form a fibred product \(T\times_Y X\) which is only unique up to a unique isomorphism. Thus implicitly there is a choice being made. This becomes a technical obstacle in developing the theory of stacks, and fibred categories are used to address this problem. For more detail, see Example 3.1.5 in Olsson’s book. </p><p>The collection of categories fibred over a fixed category is an example of a \(2\)-category. Roughly speaking, a \(2\)-category is a category where the morphisms between two objects form a category. However, we will not use higher categorical language. </p><blockquote><p>Lemma 4. Let \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal F\rightarrow\mathcal G\) be a morphism of fibred categories over \(\mathcal C\), </p><ol><li>\(\mathscr{F}\) is fully faithful (as a functor) iff \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) is fully faithful for all \(U\in\mathcal C\),</li><li>\(\mathscr{F}\) is an equivalence (of categories) iff \(\mathscr{F}_U:\mathcal F(U)\rightarrow \mathcal G(U)\) is an equivalence for all \(U\in\mathcal C\).</li></ol><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Lemma 3.1.8, Olsson.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>Recall the classical Yoneda lemma: for each object \(A\in\mathcal C\) we have a natural isomorphism between the collection of natural transformations \(\mathrm{Nat}(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{H}^A)\), and the set \(\mathscr{F}(A)\). This point of view is crucial for the development of algebraic spaces, and also for fibred categories we need a variant of this lemma.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 5 (\(2\)-Yoneda lemma). Suppose \(\mathcal F\) is fibred over \(\mathcal C\), there is an equivalence<br>\[\mathrm{MOR}_{\mathcal C}(\mathcal C/X,\mathcal F)\cong \mathcal F(X)\]given by \(\mathscr{F}\mapsto \mathscr{F}(\mathbf 1_{X})\).</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Proposition 3.2.2 Olsson.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>It is often useful to think of a fibred category as the collection of categories \(\mathcal{F}(U)\) with a pullback functor. Thus, we introduce split fibred categories. We will not go over the details of the rigorous definition, but the reader can check 3.3.1 in Olsson’s book.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;In this week we discuss fppf sites (recall that we defined \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\) in last week) and faithfully flat descent. This will help us to build our way to the definition of a stack. The idea of faifully flat descent is that a certain property of schemes can be descended via a cartesian square with a fppf side. The important result we are building towards is that for any scheme \(X\), the functor of points \(\mathscr{H}_X\) is a sheaf on the fppf site of \(X\). After this, we can talk about fibred categories. Fibred categories plus descents is categorical stacks, plus geometry is algebraic stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

In the end of this semaster hopefully I will have written enough about them in this blog so that I can compile them into actual typesetted notes. We start by revisiting étale morphisms and introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Then, we will define important sites such as the big and small Zariski sites and étale sites as well as the fppf site.<br><span id="more"></span></p><h4 id="Etale-morphisms-of-schemes"><a href="#Etale-morphisms-of-schemes" class="headerlink" title="Étale morphisms of schemes"></a>Étale morphisms of schemes</h4><p>First, we revisit the definitions and properties of étale morphisms of schemes. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A morphism of schemes \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) is <em>étale</em> if one of these equivalent conditions holds</p><ol><li>\(f\) is smooth and locally quasi-finite,</li><li>\(f\) is smooth and unramified,</li><li>\(f\) is flat and unramified,</li><li>\(f\) is locally of finite presentation and formally étale</li><li>\(f\) is locally of finite presentation and locally a standard étale morphism,</li></ol></blockquote><p>There are many more equivalent definitions of étale morphisms listed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Étale_morphism">wikipedia</a>. Intuitively, I think of étale morphisms analogous to covering maps. We need this notion to define the étale topology which we will need to use later. As a side note, there is also something called the étale fundamental group, which also uses the notion of étale morphisms. We recall these properties of étale morphisms.</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 4. </p><ol><li>compotision of étale maps are étale,</li><li>if \(f:Y\rightarrow X\) is étale then its base change \(Y\times_XZ\rightarrow Z\) is étale,</li><li>if \(f:Y\rightarrow X\) and \(g:Z\rightarrow X\) are étale and \(g=f\circ h\) where \(h:Z\rightarrow Y\), then \(h\) is étale</li><li>given algebraically closed field \(k\) and \(k\)-algebra \(A\), then the morphism \(\mathrm{Spec}(A)\rightarrow\mathrm{Spec}(k)\) is étale iff it is the disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of \(k\).</li></ol></blockquote><p>Now, we are ready to define Grothendieck topology and sites.</p><h4 id="Grothendieck-topology-sites-and-topoi"><a href="#Grothendieck-topology-sites-and-topoi" class="headerlink" title="Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi"></a>Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi</h4><p>Recall that a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space \(X\) is a contravariant functor \(\mathscr{F}:\mathrm{Op}(X)\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}\), and a presheaf is a sheaf when \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\cap U_j)\) is an equalizer for every open cover \(\{U_{i}\}\) of any open \(U\subseteq X\), which is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms. We want to extend this from \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) to any category \(\mathcal C\). To do this, we need to add some additional structure on the category \(\mathcal C\) so that its objects can be viewed as “open sets” and morphisms can be viewed as “inclusions”. Grothendieck’s insight is that we don’t need the full strength of a topology to define sheaves, we only need intersections and a notion of when a collection of an open set forms an open cover of it. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 1. A <em>Grothendieck topology</em> on a category \(\mathcal C\) is the data of a set of <em>coverings</em> of \(U\), written as \(\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), for each object \(U\in \mathcal C\), where each covering \(S\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) is a set of morphisms of \(\mathcal C\) with \(U\) as targets, such that for all \(U\in\mathcal C\)</p><ol><li>for each isomorphism \(\varphi:V\rightarrow U\), we have \(\{\varphi\}\in \mathrm{Cov}(U)\)</li><li>if \(\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) and \(\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow V_i\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(V_i)\) for each \(i\), then \(\{W_{i,j}\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\)</li><li>for \(\{V_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) and \(W\rightarrow U\), all \(W\times_UV_i\) exists and \(\{W\times_UV_i\rightarrow W\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(W)\)</li></ol><p>A category \(\mathcal C\) equipped with a choice of Grothendieck topology, also denoted \(\mathcal C\), is a <em>site</em>. A continuous functor between sites \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal D\) is a functor between their underlying categories such that for all \(\{X_i\rightarrow X\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal C}(X)\) we have \(\{f(X_i)\rightarrow f(X)\}\in \mathrm{Cov}_{\mathcal D}(f(X))\), and it commutes with finite fibred products if they exist.</p></blockquote><p>For example, \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) for a topological space \(X\) can be made into a site using the usual notion of covering. We note that in \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\) we have the fibered product \(U\times_X V=U\cap V\) for all open \(U,V\subseteq X\), which agrees with the usual notion of intersection. For a category \(\mathcal C\) with \(X\in\mathcal C\), the category of objects over \(X\), denoted \(\mathcal C/X\) is the category where objects are morphisms \(Y\rightarrow X\) in \(\mathcal C\) and morphisms between \(Y_1\rightarrow X\) and \(Y_2\rightarrow X\) are all morphisms \(Y_1\rightarrow Y_2\) in \(\mathcal C\) such that the obvious triangle commutes, i.e. \((Y_1\rightarrow Y_2\rightarrow X)=Y_1\rightarrow X\). If \(\mathcal C\) is a site, then \(\mathcal C/X\) can be given a site structure, by letting \(\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)\) in \(\mathcal C/X\) be \(\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) in \(\mathcal C\). The site \(\mathcal C/X\) is called the <em>localization</em> of the site \(\mathcal C\) at \(X\). Suppose \(X\) is a scheme, then we say that the <em>big Zariski (resp. big étale, resp. fppf) site</em>, denoted \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{Zar}}\) (resp. \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{ét}}\), resp. \((\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\mathrm{fppf}}\)) of \(X\), is the site with the category \(\mathbf{Sch}/X\) and \(\{Y_i\rightarrow Y\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) iff each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is an open immersion with \(Y=\bigcup_i Y_i\) (resp. each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is étale with \(\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y\) surjective, resp. each \(Y_i\rightarrow Y\) is flat and locally of finite presentation with \(\coprod_i Y_i\rightarrow Y\) surjective). An element of \(\mathrm{Cov}(U\rightarrow X)\) is called a <em>Zariski cover</em> (resp. <em>étale cover</em>, resp. <em>fppf cover</em>) of \(U\). The small Zariski site (resp. small étale site) of \(X\), denoted \(X_{\mathrm{Zar}}\) (resp. \(X_{\mathrm{ét}}\)) is the site whose category is the full subcategory of \(\mathrm{Sch}/X\) where each object \(U\rightarrow X\) is an open immersion (resp. étale), and the coverings are the same as the big Zariski (resp. big étale) site. The small Zariski site of \(X\) is equivalent to the site \(\mathrm{Op}(X)\). Moreover, we have the following inclusions<br>\[\{\mathrm{Zariski\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{étale\ cover}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{fppf\ cover}\}\]Next, we discuss presheaves and sheaves on a site. This whole business is to get new cohomology theories such as étale cohomology, because basic sheaf cohomology is insufficient for our needs.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. A <em>presheaf</em> (of sets) on a site \(\mathcal C\) is a contravariant functor \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathbf{Set}\), and a presheaf is a <em>sheaf</em> iff \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_{i}\mathscr{F}(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod_{i,j}\mathscr{F}(U_i\times_U U_j)\) is an equalizer for all \(U\in\mathcal C\) and \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\). A presheaf is called <em>separated</em> if for all \(U\in\mathcal C\) and \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), the map \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)\) is injective. We write \(\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) (resp. \(\mathrm{PSh}(\mathcal C)\)) for the category of sheaves (resp. presheaves) of the site \(\mathcal C\).</p></blockquote><p>Note that a separated presheaf can be viewed as a presheaf that only satisfies one of the axioms of a sheaf, the identity axiom, but not necessaily the gluability axiom, therefore we have the obvious inclusions<br>\[\{\mathrm{sheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{separated\ presheaves}\}\hookrightarrow\{\mathrm{presheaves}\}\]all of which admits left adjoints, the composition of them being sheafification. Usually, we can formulate sheafification in terms of compatible germs, but since we are working over sites, it does not make sense to take a point in an object and take the product of stalks. The way we construct the adjoint from presheaves to separated presheaves is to map a presheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) to \(\mathscr{F}^{\mathrm s}(U)=\mathscr{F}(U)/\sim\) where \(a\sim b\) iff exists \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\) such that \(a,b\) are mapped to the same element by the map \(\mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \prod_i\mathscr{F}(U_i)\). We can check that this is in fact a separated presheaf. All of the above works for (pre)sheaves of rings, abelian groups, etc.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A <em>topos</em> is a category equivalent to \(\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) for a site \(\mathcal C\). A morphism of topoi \(f:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2\) is an adjoint pair \(f^*\dashv f_*\) of functors \(f^*:\mathcal{T}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_2\) and \(f_*:\mathcal{T}_2\rightarrow \mathcal{T}_1\) with a choice of natural isomorphism<br>\[\Phi:\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_1}(f^*(-),-)\rightarrow \mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal T_2}(-,f_*(-))\]where each naturality here means \(\Phi\) is natural in each of the two dashes, and \(f^*\) commutes with finite limits when they exist. Define composition in the obvious way.</p></blockquote><p>We remark that in the above definition, commuting with finite limits is equivalent to checking that \(f^*\) commutes with finite products and preserve equalizers. In many cases, though not always, a continuous functor between sites \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D\) induces a functor \(f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) by \(f_*(\mathscr{F})(X)=\mathscr{F}(f(X))\), where the well-definedness follows from \(\mathscr{F}(f(U_i\times_U U_j))=\mathscr{F}(f(U_i)\times_{f(U)} f(U_j))\) for any \(\{U_i\rightarrow U\}\in\mathrm{Cov}(U)\), as illustrated by the diagram <div class="quiver-container"><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=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&embed" width="545" height="182" scrolling="yes" style="overflow-x: auto !important; overflow-y: hidden !important;"></iframe></div><br>This induced functor does not always admit a left adjoint. However, we have the following theorem</p><blockquote><p>Proposition 4. If \(\mathcal C,\mathcal D\) are sites with small underlying categories, then the functor \(f_*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\) induced by a continuous functor \(f:\mathcal C\rightarrow \mathcal D\) admits a left adjoint \(f^*:\mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal C)\rightarrow \mathrm{Sh}(\mathcal D)\). If, further, that finite limits in \(\mathcal C\) are representable and \(f\) commutes with them, then \(f^*\) commutes with finite limits.<br><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>We construct this functor concretely. For each \(U\in\mathcal D\), let \(\mathcal I_U\) be the category where objects are pairs \(\langle V,\rho\rangle\) where \(V\in\mathcal C\) and \(\rho\in \mathrm{Mor}_\mathcal{D}(U,f(V))\), and a morphism \(g:\langle V_1,\rho_1\rangle \rightarrow \langle V_2,\rho_2\rangle\) is a morphism \(g:V_1\rightarrow V_2\) in \(\mathcal C\) such that \((fg)\circ\rho_1=\rho_2\). We define\[f^*(\mathscr{F})(U)=\lim_{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\langle V,\rho\rangle\in\mathcal I_{U}^\mathrm{op}}}\mathscr{F}(V)\]and for each \(h:U_1\rightarrow U_2\) in \(\mathcal C\), there is functor \(\mathcal I_{U_2}\rightarrow \mathcal I_{U_1}\) given by \(\langle V,\rho\rangle\mapsto \langle V,\rho\circ h\rangle\) which induces a morphism \(f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_2)\rightarrow f^*(\mathscr{F})(U_1)\). We can check that this is well-defined.</p>    </div></div></p></blockquote><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

Some other texts we use are &lt;em&gt;Algebraic Geometry&lt;/em&gt; by Robin Hartshorne and &lt;em&gt;Categories and Homological Algebra&lt;/em&gt; by Pierre Schapira.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.” </p><p style="text-align: right;"> George Cantor </p></blockquote><p>This week I finally finished my final project for my PMATH 499 reading course in arithmetic geometry. My project is called “Galois cohomology and weak Mordell—Weil theorem”, which is available <a href="/documents/Galois_Cohomology.pdf">here</a>. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \(k\) with an algebraic closure \(K\), the Galois group \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit of topological Galois groups \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \(L/k\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \(G\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \(G\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology  where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \(G\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation.<br><span id="more"></span></p><p>My final project focuses on the proof of the weak Mordell—Weil theorem, which states that for any elliptic curve \(E\), the group \(E(k)/nE(k)\) is finite for all \(n\ge 2\). This is an important step in the proof of the Mordell—Weil theorem which states the elliptic curve groups are finitely generated. The proof of Mordell—Weil involves in applying an infinite descent argument to weak Mordell—Weil, which I will not go into detail. The motivating observation is that we have an exact sequence of topological \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\)-modules \[\mathbf{0}\rightarrow E(K)[n]\rightarrow E(K)\xrightarrow{n}E(K)\rightarrow\mathbf{0}\]This short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which we truncate after the first cohomology groups. The first cohomology group can be viewed as the group of crossed homomorphisms module the principal crossed homomorphisms, where a crossed homomorphism is some \(f\) with \(f(gh)=gf(h)+f(g)\) for all \(g,h\) and a principal crossed homomorphism is a homomorphism where there exists \(m\) with \(f(g)=gm-m\) for all \(g\). This can be verified by just computing out the differential. Next, we define the \(n\)-Selmer groups and the Tate-Shafarevich group, which is applied to the induced exact sequence we just found in order to obtain a better bound for the group \(E(k)/nE(k)\). Finally, the finiteness of \(E(k)/nE(k)\) is obtained from the finiteness of the Selmer groups.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>
