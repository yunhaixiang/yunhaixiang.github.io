As mathematicians, we suddenly find ourselves confronting the grim possibility that AI might one day reach the frontiers of research or even beyond – it is like the sword of Damocles, a spectre looming in the background. My fear is not the cliched scifi trope of some Skynet-like AI obliterating humanity. Rather, my fear is that long before AI poses any physical threat — if it ever does — it will crush our senses of meaning and purpose, that they will destroy us spiritually way before they do physically. </p><span id="more"></span><p>This experience is not unique to mathematicians. After the advant of diffusion models, I see many artists expressing their existential frustration about AI art, and the same happened with musicians and novelists. Years after AlphaGo defeated the best human Go player, top Go player Ke Jie also expressed his existential confusion in a talk. It should be noted that all these anxieties are not simply that AI might “take our jobs”. No, it is something much deeper. To many of these people, what they do constitutes a large part of their meaning for existence. They pride themselves on this attitude and they appreciate this in each other. The confrontation with AI has forced them into an uncomfortable philosophical quandary: either they concede that AIs shares their existential stature as creative beings (and often better ones at that), or they accept the nihilistic and painful indictment that their craft holds little inherent meaning. This is the ultimate melancholy. How do we grapple with this dilemma? Will we ever be able to find a <em>modus vivendi</em> with AI? This question has been haunting me for the last few weeks. </p><p>Existentialism is a reaction to <em>nihilism</em> caused by the <em>crisis of modernity</em>. Following the Enlightenment, modern science irrevocable devastated the premodern existential narrative based on religious faith. This is epitomized by Nietzsche’s famous proclaimation, “God is dead”. As a result, for the industralized world, more and more people have been placing their purposes and meanings of life to personal, often creative, endeavours, instead of a devotion to religion. One of the most important ideas of Jean-Paul Sarte, one of the greatest French existentialist philosophers of the last century, is <em>l’existence précède l’essence</em>, i.e. existence precedes essence. The <em>essence</em> of a thing, in Sartrean jargon, is the attributes of which that characterizes its existence – the essence of an object is what makes it what it is. A chair, for example, is characterized by the attributes of “chairness” (such as to provide a surface on which to sit) as its predetermined essence or purpose. By saying that existence precedes essence, Sarte argues that we do not exist due to any predetermined inherent essence – we have to create our own purposes. This could mean many activities depending on the person (art, music, math being some examples). </p><p>However, I believe that the emergence of AI challenges precisely this narrative. We find that AI is capable of performing the very activities we find meaningful for ourselves, all the while being staunchly inhuman – it remains something created for the purpose of serving humans, an object with an essence. For me, this gives me a feeling of horror similar to the uncanny valley. It is the feeling of <em>something inhuman is somehow more human than me</em>. Hence the aforementioned dilemma: either AI is truly as human as I am, or these activities are not really all that meaningful. Realistically speaking, I don’t seriously think AI could completely replace human mathematicians, so there should still be meaning in doing mathematics in the future, albeit probably with the help of AI as some super advanced logico-calculator. However, for people who are affected by AI in this way, myself included, I think AI compels them to rethink profoundly what makes their lives meaningful. </p><!-- However, in today's world, I claim that we are facing a different existential crisis, of which AI is but a facet. Following the information age, we are daily bombarded with an explosive amount of information on social media. Ostensibly, the internet is supposed to connect people, but beneath it there always lurks this feeling of disconnection. Why, paradoxically, do we feel more alienated than ever?

A symmetric polynomial is \(f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in \mathbb Z[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) such that for any permutation \(\sigma\in S_n\), we have \(\sigma f=f\) where \(\sigma\) acts by permuting the variables. The symmetric polynomials form a subring of \(\mathbb Z[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) which we denote as \(\Lambda_n\). One example of symmetric polynomials is the Newton power sums \(p_k=x_1^k+\cdots+x_n^k\) for \(k\ge 1\). Another example is elementary symmetric polynomials \(e_k=\sum_{1\le i_1&lt;\cdots&lt; i_k\le n}x_{i_1}\cdots x_{i_k}\) for \(1\le k\le n\). They arise in Vieta’s relations for a polynomial equation. Obviously \(\Lambda_n\) is a graded ring in degree. For a monomial \(u=ax^{k_1}_1\cdots x^{k_n}_n\), we define its weight as \(\mathrm{wt}(u)=k_1+2k_2+\cdots+nk_n\), and for a polynomial \(f\) define \(\mathrm{wt}(f)\) as the largest weight occuring among its monomials. We note that the weight of a polynomial is the same as the degree of \(f(e_1,\dots,e_n)\). One of the first results in symmetric polynomials is that the elementary symmetric polynomials forms a generating set of \(\Lambda_n\) as a (graded) algebra over \(\mathbb Z\). This is our first theorem. </p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials). For each symmetric polynomial \(g\) of degree \(d\) there exists a unique polynomial \(f\) of weight at most \(d\) such that \(g(x_1,\dots,x_n)=f(e_1,\dots,e_n)\). </p></blockquote><p>Another set of generators is the complete symmetric polynomial \(h_k=\sum_{1\le i_1\le \cdots\le i_k\le n}x_{i_1}\cdots x_{i_k}\) for \(1\le k\le n\). Consider the generating functions \(E(t)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty e_kt^k\) and \(H(t)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty h_k t^k\). One can show that<br>\[E(t)=\prod_{i=1}^n(1+x_it)\quad H(t)=\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{1-x_it}\]Therefore one has \(E(t)H(-t)=1\). By multiplying out coefficients this gives a relation between \(e_k\) and \(h_k\). When the polynomials are over \(\mathbb Q\) or any field, we have another set of generators which is the Newton power sums \(p_k\). For a partition \(\lambda\), we define \(e_{\lambda}=e_{\lambda_1}\cdots e_{\lambda_m}\), and similarly for \(h_{\lambda},p_{\lambda}\) and so on. Define the symmetric monomial basis \(m_{\lambda}=\sum_{\sigma\in S(\lambda)}x^{\lambda_1}_{\sigma(1)}\cdots x^{\lambda_n}_{\sigma(n)}\) where \(S(\lambda)=S_{n}/\mathrm{Stab}_{S_n}(\lambda)\), then this is an integral basis as well. </p><p>A polynomial is skew-symmetric if \(\sigma f=\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)f\) for all permutations \(\sigma\). The skew-symmetric polynomials \(\mathrm{Skew}(n)\) is a module over \(\Lambda_n\). Define the alteration of a polynomial \(\mathrm{Alt}(f)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma) \sigma f\). Let \(a_{\alpha}=\mathrm{Alt}(x_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots x_n^{\alpha_n})\) where \(\alpha\) is a partition without repetitions, they form a basis for \(\mathrm{Skew}(n)\). Let \(\delta_n=(n-1,n-2,\dots,1)\). For a partition \(\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)\), define the Schur polynomial \(s_{\lambda}=a_{\lambda+\delta_n}/a_{\delta}\), they also form a basis for symmetric functions. Here are some identities for transition of basis</p><blockquote><p>Theorem (First Jacobi-Trudi Identity).<br>\[s_{\lambda}=\mathrm{det}(\{h_{\lambda_{i}+j-i}\}_{i,j})=\operatorname{det}\left(\begin{array}{cccc}h_{\lambda_1} &amp; h_{\lambda_1+1} &amp; \ldots &amp; h_{\lambda_1+n-1} \\ h_{\lambda_2-1} &amp; h_{\lambda_2} &amp; \ldots &amp; h_{\lambda_2+n-2} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ h_{\lambda_n-n+1} &amp; h_{\lambda_n-n+2} &amp; \ldots &amp; h_{\lambda_n}\end{array}\right) .\]</p></blockquote><p>There are similar transition determinental identities between \(h_k,e_k,p_k\). Note that \(s_\lambda s_\mu=\sum_\nu c_{\lambda \mu}^v s_v\) where \(c_{\lambda \mu}^v\) is called the structure constant. This constant is usually difficult to find. To find them we need the following theorem. </p><blockquote><p>Theorem (Pieri formulas). Let \(\lambda\otimes 1^k\) (resp. \(\lambda\otimes k\)) be the partitions obtained from \(\lambda\) by adding \(k\) boxes to its Young diagram such that no two boxes belong to the same row (resp. column).<br>\[s_\lambda e_k=\sum_{\mu \in \lambda \otimes 1^k} s_\mu,\quad s_\lambda h_k=\sum_{\mu \in \lambda \otimes k} s_\mu\]</p></blockquote><p>Littlewood showed that Schur polynomials can be represented by sum indexed by semistandard Young tableaus \(s_\lambda\left(x_1, \ldots, x_n\right)=\sum_{T \in \operatorname{SSYT}_\lambda(n)} \mathbf{x}^T .\) Define \(\Lambda=\displaystyle\lim_{\longleftarrow}\Lambda_n\) the ring of symmetric functions. Let \(\omega:\Lambda\rightarrow\Lambda\) be \(\omega(h_{\lambda})=e_{\lambda}\), then \(\omega^2=\mathrm{id}\). Define also bilinear form \(\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle:\Lambda^2\rightarrow\mathbb R\) extended by \(\langle m_{\lambda},h_{\mu}\rangle=\delta_{\lambda\mu}\). Wrt this form, the Schur polynomials form an orthonormal basis with \(\omega\) an isometry of it. This is the Hall inner product. </p><p>One application of symmetric polynomials is Lagrange’s solution to depressed quartic equation. Let \(\alpha_i\) be the roots of \(x^4+a_2x^2+a_3x+a_4=0\). Let \(f_1=(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)(\alpha_3+\alpha_4)\) and \(f_2,f_3\) the other two in its orbit, then for any symmetric polynomial \(s\), we have \(s(f_1,f_2,f_3)\) is symmetric. Thus \(u_{i}=e_i(f_1,f_2,f_3)\) are symmetric for \(i=1,2,3\). Then \(u_i\) can be written as a polynomial in terms of \(a_i\) by Vieta. Since \(x^3-u_1x^2+u_2x+u_3\) has coefficients polynomials in \(a_i\), we can use the cubic formula to solve for \(f_i\) in terms of \(a_i\). Using \(f_1=(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)(\alpha_3+\alpha_4)=-(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)^2\) since \(\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3+\alpha_4=0\), and likewise for \(f_2,f_3\), we can solve for \(\alpha_i\) in terms of \(a_i\).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“What is mathematics? It is only a systematic effort of solving puzzles posed by nature.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Shakuntala Devi </p></blockquote><p>Recently I’ve been learning about Grothendieck-Witt rings because I want to know about \(\mathbb A^1\)-enumerative geometry. The Grothendieck-Witt ring of a field (of characteristic different from \(2\)) is formed using quadratic forms over it. Let \(k\) be a field of characteristic not \(2\). A quadratic form is a degree \(2\) homogeneous polynomial over \(k\), say \(f=\sum_{1\le i,j\le n}a_{i,j}x_{i}x_{j}\). Of course \(x_{i}x_{j}=x_{j}x_{i}\), so we can rewrite \(f=\sum_{1\le i,j\le n}a^\prime_{i,j}x_{i}x_{j}\) where \(a^\prime_{i,j}=\frac{1}{2}(a_{i,j}+a_{j,i})\), we can then associate to it a symmetric matrix \(M_f=(a^\prime_{i,j})_{1\le i,j\le n}\). We see that \(f=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm T}M_f\mathbf{x}\) where \(\mathbf{x}=(x_i)_{1\le i\le n}\). Two \(n\)-ary quadratic forms \(f,g\) are said to be equivalent if there is \(A\in \mathrm{GL}_n(k)\) such that \(f(\mathbf{x})=g(A\mathbf{x})\). Equivalently their associated symmetric matrix are equivalent iff \(M_f=A^{\mathrm T}M_g A\) for some \(A\in \mathrm{GL}_n(k)\), i.e. congruence of matrices. </p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Example. \(f(x,y)=xy\) and \(g(x,y)=x^2-y^2\) are equivalent by change of variables \(x\mapsto x+y\) and \(y\mapsto x-y\). Their associated matrices are<br>\[M_f=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1/2\\ 1/2 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}\quad M_g=\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1\end{pmatrix}\] and the change of variable matrix \(A=\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; -1\end{pmatrix}\). </p></blockquote><p>In all following, all vector spaces are finite-dimensional. A quadratic space \((V,q)\) over \(k\) is a vector space \(V\) over \(k\) and a function \(q:V\rightarrow k\) called a quadratic map satisfying \(q(ax)=a^2q(x)\) for all \(a\in k\) and \(x\in V\), and such that \((u,v)\mapsto q(u+v)-q(u)-q(v)\) is bilinear. An equivalence of quadratic spaces \((V_1,q_1),(V_2,q_2)\) is an isomorphism \(\varphi:V_1\rightarrow V_2\) such that \(q_1(x)=q_2(\varphi(x))\) for all \(x\in V_1\). Obviously an \(n\)-ary quadratic form \(f\) gives rise to a quadratic space \((k^n,f)\) where \(f\) is the map of evaluating \(f\). In the other direction, for a quadratic space \((V,q)\), choose a basis \(e_i\), then this corresponds to a quadratic form \(f=\sum_{1\le i,j\le n}a_{i,j} x_ix_j\) where \(a_{i,j}=\frac{1}{2}(q(e_i+e_j)-q(e_i)-q(e_j))\), and in particular \(a_{i,i}=q(e_i)\). We see that a quadratic space is equivalent to a quadratic form. Another equivalent structure is \((V,B)\), a vector space \(V\) over \(k\) with a symmetric bilinear form \(B:V^2\rightarrow k\). Each \((V,B)\) determines a quadratic space \((V,q)\) where \(q(x)=B(x,x)\). In the other direction, for a quadratic space \((V,q)\) we have a symmetric bilinear form \(B(v,w)=\frac{1}{2}(q(v+w)-q(v)-q(w))\), called its polarization. An equivalence or isometry between \((V_1,B_1),(V_2,B_2)\) is a linear isomorphism \(\varphi:V_1\rightarrow V_2\) such that \(B_1(v,w)=B_2(\varphi(v),\varphi(w))\). We say a quadratic form is nondegenerate if the associated symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate, or equivalently the associated symmetric matrix is invertible. A diagonal quadratic form is a quadratic form with a diagonal symmetric matrix. Every quadratic form is equivalent to a diagonal form. </p><blockquote><p>Definition. A quadratic form \(f\) represents some \(d\in k^\times\) if there exists \(\lambda\in k^n\) with \(f(\lambda)=d\). Let \(D(f)\) be the subset of \(k^\times\) represented by \(f\). </p></blockquote><p>For quadratic forms \(f,g\), their orthogonal sum \(f\oplus g\) is \(f(x)+g(y)\), equivalent to taking block diagonal of their matrices, equivalent to direct sum of quadratic space (with sum of quadratic map), and equivalent to direct sum of symmetric bilinear space (with sum of symmetric bilinear form). </p><blockquote><p>Theorem. For a quadratic form \(f\) on \(V\), some \(d\in k^\times\) is representable iff \(V\cong \langle d\rangle\otimes W\) for \(W\) another quadratic space. As a result, \(V\cong \langle a_1,\dots,a_n\rangle \) for some \(a_i\). </p></blockquote><p>Define the determinant of a quadratic form \(f\) to be the image of \(\det M_f\) in \(k^\times/(k^\times)^2\). Define \(\mathbb H=\langle 1, -1\rangle\) the hyperbolic plane, and its arbitrary orthogonal sum is hyperbolic space (including zero space). A quadratic space is isotropic if there is a nonzero vector \(x\) such that \(q(x)=0\) (an isotropic vector), and totally isotropic if every nonzero vector is isotropic, and anisotrpic if not isotropic. </p><blockquote><p>Theorem (Witt Decomposition). Each quadratic space is a orthogonal sum of a totally isotropic space, a hyperbolic space, and an anisotropic space, all unique up to equivalence. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Theorem (Witt Cancellation). If \(q\oplus q_1\cong q\oplus q_2\) then \(q_1\cong q_2\). </p></blockquote><p>We can define tensors of quadratic spaces by tensoring their underlying space and multiplying the quadratic map. Then orthogonal sum and tensor define a semiring on the set \(M\) of equivalence classes of quadratic spaces. Define inverse formally on \(M^2\) by \((x,y)\sim (s,t)\) iff \(x+t=s+y\). Multiplication is defined in the obvious way. The resulting ring is the Grothendieck-Witt ring \(\mathrm{GW}(k)\). The integer multiples of hyperbolic space \((\mathbb H)\) is an ideal in the GW ring, the quotient \(\mathrm{W}(k)=\mathrm{GW}(k)/(\mathbb H)\) is the Witt ring. </p><p>For more read <a href="https://kyleormsby.github.io/files/quadratic_TNR.pdf">here</a>. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

    <title>Uniformization Theorem for Elliptic Curves</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“The pursuit of mathematics is a divine madness of the human spirit.” </p><p style="text-align: right;"> Alfred North Whitehead </p></blockquote><p>In this post, we prove the uniformization theorem for elliptic curves. The theorem states that every elliptic curve over the complex numbers arose from the complex plane modulo a lattice, and vice versa. In fact there is an isomorphism between them which is both complex analytic and algebraic. This shows that elliptic curves over complex numbers is a torus. </p><span id="more"></span><p>A lattice \(L=[\omega_1,\omega_2]\subseteq \mathbb C\) is an additive subgroup \(\omega_1\mathbb Z+\omega_2\mathbb Z\subseteq \mathbb C\) with \(\omega_1,\omega_2\) linearly independent. For example, if \(\mathcal O=\mathbb Z[\tau]\) is an imaginary quadratic order, the it gives rise to lattice \([1,\tau]\). An elliptic function for a lattice \(L\) is a meromorphic function \(f:D\subseteq \mathbb C\rightarrow\mathbb C\) that is doubly-periodic w.r.t. \(L\), i.e. \(f(z+\omega)=f(z)\) for all \(\omega\in L\). Elliptic functions form a field \(\mathbb C(L)\). We recall Cauchy’s principle argument. </p><blockquote><p>Theorem (Cauchy). Let \(\gamma\) be a simply closed positively oriented curve with interior \(\Gamma\). Let \(f\) be a function meromorphic on an open set \(\Omega\) containing \(\Gamma\) and \(\gamma\) that has no zero or pole on \(\gamma\), and \(g\) a nonzero function holomorphic on \(\Omega\), then for \(z_0\in\Gamma\) \[\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\gamma}g(z)\frac{f^\prime(z)}{f(z)}\mathrm dz=\sum_{\omega\in \Gamma}g(z_0)\mathrm{ord}_{w}(f)\] when \(g(z)=1\), the rhs is the difference between the number of zeros and poles in \(\Omega\). </p></blockquote><p>This theorem is proved by writing \(f,g\) in terms of their Laurent series about \(z_0\) and using Residue theorem. A corollary from this is that in any fundamental paralellogram \(F_{\alpha}=\alpha+\{t_1\omega_1+t_2\omega_2:0\le t_1,t_2&lt;1\}\), the number of poles is equal to the number of zeros. </p><blockquote><p>Definition. Let \(L\) be a lattice and \(k&gt;2\) an integer. The Einsenstein series of weight \(k\) is \[G_{k}(L)=\sum_{\omega\in L\setminus\{0\}}\frac{1}{\omega^k}\] Consider lattices \([1,\tau]\) for \(\tau\in\mathbb H\) where \(\mathbb H=\{z\in\mathbb C:\mathrm{Im}(z)&gt;0\}\) is the upper-half plane, we define \(G_{k}(\tau)=G_{k}([1,\tau])\), so that \(G_k\) is a funciton on the upper-half plane \(\mathbb H\). </p></blockquote><p>If \(k\) is odd then the term \(\frac{1}{\omega^k}\) cancels with \(\frac{1}{(-\omega)^k}\), so the only interesting Einsenstein series are those of even weight. The Einsenstein series converges absolutely. </p><blockquote><p>Definition. A Weierstrass \(\wp\)-function of a lattice \(L\) is \[\wp(z ; L)=\frac{1}{z^2}+\sum_{\omega \in L^*}\left(\frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\frac{1}{\omega^2}\right)\] we write \(\wp(z)\) when there is no confusion of the lattice. </p></blockquote><p>The \(\wp\)-function has a pole of order \(w\) at each lattice point, and these are all the poles. Its derivative is</p><p>\[\wp^\prime(z)=-2\sum_{\omega\in L}\frac{1}{(z-\omega)^3}\]</p><p>It follows that \(\wp, \wp^\prime\) are elliptic functions. We will now derive a differential equation that reveals its link to elliptic curves. By expanding the \(\wp\)-function into series, we can write it in terms of Einsenstein series. \[\wp(z)=\frac{1}{z^2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(2 n+1) G_{2 n+2}(L) z^{2 n}\]</p><p>The critical observation is that \(\wp \) satisfies the following differential equations. </p><blockquote><p>Theorem. Let \(L\) be a lattice, then \[\wp^{\prime}(z)^2=4 \wp(z)^3-g_2(L) \wp(z)-g_3(L),\] where \(g_2(L)=60G_4(L)\) and \(g_3(L)=140 G_6(L)\)</p></blockquote><p>This corresponds to an elliptic curve by letting \(y=\wp^\prime(z)\) and \(x=\wp(z)\), so we have an elliptic curve \(y^2=4 x^3-g_2(L) x-g_3(L)\), iff the discriminant \(\Delta(L)=g_2(L)^3-27g_3(L)^2\) is nonzero, and this is always nonzero. We now have a map that gives an elliptic curve for each lattice</p><p>\[\Phi:\mathbb C/L\rightarrow E(\mathbb C)\quad z\mapsto (\wp(z),\wp^\prime(z))\]</p><p>This is an isomorphism of groups and complex manifolds. Moreover, all elliptic curves arise this way. For a proof, consult <a href="https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.783/2015/LectureNotes16.pdf">here</a>, becuase I’m too lazy to prove the rest. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

This proof is shorter, more conceptual (uses universal properties without invoking concrete generators and relations), and uses covering spaces. </p><span id="more"></span><p>Let \(X\) be a topological space with all the nice connectedness properties, in particular, we assume it has a universal covering \(u:\widetilde{X}\rightarrow X\). Let \(G\) be a group, \(x\in X\), and \(\rho:\pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow G\) a homomorphism. We define a based \(G\)-covering \(p_{\rho}:(Y_\rho,y_\rho)\rightarrow (X,x)\). Take the product \(\widetilde{X}\times G\) with \(G\) having the discrete topology, and \(\pi_1(X,x)\) acts on it by \(\sigma\cdot(z,g)=(\sigma\cdot z,g\rho(\sigma^{-1}) )\). Take \(Y_\rho=(\widetilde{X}\times G)/\pi_1(X,x)\) by this action, and \(y_{\rho}\) the image of \((\widetilde{x},1)\). Note that we have \((\sigma\cdot z,g)=(z,g\rho(\sigma))\) in \(Y_\rho\). Let \(p_\rho:Y_{\rho}\rightarrow X\) be \((z,g)\mapsto u(z)\). The group \(G\) acts on \(Y_\rho\) by \(h\cdot (z,g)=(z,hg)\) evenly, making \(Y_{\rho}\) a \(G\)-covering. Conversely, suppose \(p:(Y,y)\rightarrow (X,x)\) is a \(G\)-covering, we constrct a morphism \(\pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow G\). For \(\sigma\in \pi_1(X,x)\), we let \(\rho(\sigma)\) be the element that acts by \(\rho(\sigma)\cdot y=y*\sigma\) where \(y*\sigma\) is the end point of the path that lifts \(\sigma\). </p><blockquote><p>Theorem. This construction gives a bijection<br>\[\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(X,x),G)\leftrightarrow \{G\textrm{-coverings}\ \textrm{of}\ (X,x)\}\] up to isomorphisms.</p></blockquote><p>Checking this is routine. Let \(X=U\cup V\) with \(U,V\) path-connected and intersect nontrivially, with base point \(x\in U\cap V\). Suppose there are coverings \(p:\widetilde{U}\rightarrow U\) and \(q:\widetilde{V}\rightarrow V\) and an isomorphism \(\nu:p^{-1}(U\cap V)\rightarrow q^{-1}(U\cap V)\), then one can glue them together to a covering of \(X\), by taking \(\widetilde{X}=\widetilde{U}\times\widetilde{V}/(\nu(y_1)\sim \nu(y_2))\). We can generalize this to the case where \(X\) is the union of a family of open sets, in which case we require a cocycle condition to be satisfied in order to be able to glue the covering spaces. </p><blockquote><p>Theorem (van Kampen). For any \(h_1:\pi_1(U,x)\rightarrow G\) and \(h_2:\pi_1(V,x)\rightarrow G\) with \(h_1\circ i_1=h_2\circ i_2\) where \(i_1,i_2\) are induced by inclusions \(U\cap V\hookrightarrow U \) and \(U\cap V\hookrightarrow V \), there exists a unique morphism \(h:\pi_1(X,x)\rightarrow G\) such that \(h\circ j_1=h_1\) and \(h\circ j_2=h_2\) where \(j_1,j_2\) are induced by inclusions \(U\hookrightarrow X\) and \(V\hookrightarrow X\). </p></blockquote><p>Diagrammically, this is saying \(\pi_1(X,x)\) is a fibred coproduct in the category of groups, which is a free product with amalgamation, as shown below <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMCwwLCJcXHBpXzEoVVxcY2FwIFYpIl0sWzEsMCwiXFxwaV8xKFUpIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxwaV8xKFYpIl0sWzEsMSwiXFxwaV8xKFgpIl0sWzIsMiwiRyJdLFswLDEsImlfMSJdLFswLDIsImlfMiIsMl0sWzIsMywial8yIiwyXSxbMSwzLCJqXzEiXSxbMSw0LCJoXzEiLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTJ9XSxbMiw0LCJoXzIiLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6Mn1dLFszLDQsImgiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XV0=&embed" width="275" height="275" style="border-radius: 0px; border: none;"></iframe> The homomorphisms \(h_1,h_2\) determine \(G\)-coverings \(Y_1\rightarrow U\) and \(Y_2\rightarrow V\). The commutativity of the square means that their restrictions to \(U\cap V\) are isomorphic \(G\)-coverings, thus by previous work, they glue to a covering which restricts to \(U,V\).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“Algebra is but written geometry and geometry is but figured algebra.” </p><p style="text-align: right;"> Sophie Germain </p></blockquote><p>Recall that for a topological space \(X\), a fibre bundle of fibres \(F\), where \(F\) is a topological space, is a topological space \(E\), with a surjective map \(\pi: E\rightarrow X\) such that for all \(x\in X\), exists an open nbhd \(x\in U\subseteq X\) such that there is a homeomorphism \(\varphi: \pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F\) such that \(\mathrm{pr}_U\circ \varphi=\pi|_{\pi^{-1}(U)}\) where \(\mathrm{pr}_U:U\times F\rightarrow U\) is the projection onto \(U\). Fibre bundles generalize vector bundles and covering spaces. In this post, we interpret this algebraically and generalize this notion to schemes. </p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Symmetric-Algebra-and-Quasi-coherent-Bundles"><a href="#Symmetric-Algebra-and-Quasi-coherent-Bundles" class="headerlink" title="Symmetric Algebra and Quasi-coherent Bundles"></a>Symmetric Algebra and Quasi-coherent Bundles</h4><p>Recall that for \(M\) an \(A\)-module, its tensor algebra is the graded algebra \(T(M)=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}T^n(M)\) where \(T^n(M)=M^{\otimes n}\). The symmetric algebra is the algebra \(\mathrm{Sym}(M)=T(M)/I\) where \(I\) is the ideal generated by the set \(\{m\otimes n-n\otimes m:m,n\in M\}\), which is a graded algebra \(\mathrm{Sym}(M)=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathrm{Sym}^n(M)\) since \(I\) is homogeneous. Note that \(\mathrm{Sym}^0(M)=A\) and \(\mathrm{Sym}^1(M)=M\), so there is a map \(i:\mathrm{Sym}^1(M)=M\rightarrow \mathrm{Sym}(M)\). The symmetric algebra has the universal property that the precomposition \(\varphi\mapsto \varphi\circ i\) induces a bijection </p><p>\[\mathrm{Hom}_{A-\mathrm{Alg}}(\mathrm{Sym}(M),B)\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}_{A-\mathrm{Mod}}(M,B)\]</p><p>for every \(A\)-algebra \(B\). Setting \(B=\mathrm{Sym}(N)\), we see from this that we can find \(\mathrm{Sym}(u):\mathrm{Sym}(M)\rightarrow\mathrm{Sym}(N)\) which is a graded morphism, so \(\mathrm{Sym}\) is a functor from the category of \(A\)-modules to the category of graded \(A\)-algebras. We globalize this construction to schemes. Let \(X\) be a scheme (a more generally a ringed space), and \(\mathcal E\) and \(\mathcal O_X\)-module, then define the graded \(\mathcal O_X\)-algebra \(\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal E)=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathrm{Sym}^n(\mathcal E)\) be the sheafification of \(U\mapsto \mathrm{Sym}_{\Gamma(U,\mathcal O_X)}(\Gamma(U,\mathcal E))\), and similar to the local case, we have a bijection</p><p>\[\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal O_X-\mathrm{Alg}}(\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal E), \mathcal A)\rightarrow \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal O_X-\mathrm{Mod}}(\mathcal E, \mathcal A)\]</p><p>Let \(\mathcal B\) be a quasicoherent \(\mathcal O_X\)-algebra. There exists an \(X\)-scheme \(\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathcal B)\), such that for all \(X\)-schemes \(f:T\rightarrow X\) there are bijections functorial in \(T\) of the following form </p><p>\[\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Sch}/X}(T,\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathcal B))\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal O_X-\mathrm{Alg}}(\mathcal B,f_*\mathcal O_T)\]</p><p>In other words, the functor \((\mathrm{Sch}/X)^{\mathrm{op}}\rightarrow \mathbf{Set}\) given by \((f: T \rightarrow X) \mapsto \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X-\mathrm{Alg}}\left(\mathcal{B}, f_* \mathcal{O}_T\right)\) is representable. To see this, we note that this is a sheaf on the Zariski site, since \(f_*\) and \(\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal B,-)\) are left-exact. We also have this is covered by representable open subfunctors. More concretely, the points of \(\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathcal B)\) above \(x\in X\) is that of \(\mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal \Gamma(B,\mathcal O_X)\otimes \kappa(p))\) and the topology above an open affine \(U=\mathrm{Spec}(A)\) is \(\mathrm{Spec}(\Gamma(U,\mathcal B))\). For every quasi-coherent \(\mathcal O_X\)-module \(\mathcal E\), we define \(\mathbb V(\mathcal E)=\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(\mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal E))\) functorial in \(E\) which the call the quasi-coherent bundle associated to \(E\). When restricted to locally free \(\mathcal O_X\)-modules, this functor provides a correspondance to algebraic vector bundles, where algebraic vector bundles are understood as follows, </p><blockquote><p>Definition. A vector bundle of rank \(n\in\mathbb N\) on \(X\) is an \(X\)-scheme \(V\) with an equivalence class of families \((U_i, c_i)\) where \((U_i)_i\) is an open cover of \(V\) and isomorphisms \(c_i:V|_{U_i}\rightarrow \mathbb A^{n}_{U_i}\) of \(U_i\)-schemes, such that for all \(i,j\), the automorphisms \(c_i\circ c_j:\mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U_j}\rightarrow \mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U_j}\) are linear, where two such families, called atlases, are equivalent if their union is an atlas. Moreover, define a morphisms of vector bundles \((V,U_i,c_i)\rightarrow (V^\prime,U^\prime_i,c^\prime_i)\) as a \(X\)-morphism \(f:V\rightarrow V^\prime\) such that \(c^\prime_j\circ f\circ c_i^{-1}:\mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U^\prime_j}\rightarrow \mathbb A^n_{U_i\cap U^\prime_j}\) is linear. </p></blockquote><p>The locally free \(\mathcal O_X\)-modules are interpreted as sheaf of sections over the vector bundle. More specifically, for a vector bundle \(E\) as above, we define a locally free \(\mathcal O_X\)-module \(\mathcal E_V\) as the following. Define the sheaf \(\mathcal P( V/X)\) of abelian groups by attaching to \(U\subseteq X\) the sections of \(V\) over \(U\), that is, morphisms \(s:U\rightarrow V|_U\) with \(f\circ s=\mathrm{id}_U\), and restrictions are given by restrictions of scheme morphisms. Locally, this has the structure of \(\mathcal O_X^n\) which gives the module structure. This gives the inverse to \(\mathbb V(-)\). This correspondance is part of what is known as Serre-Swan theorem</p><h4 id="Cartier-Divisors-and-Weil-divisors"><a href="#Cartier-Divisors-and-Weil-divisors" class="headerlink" title="Cartier Divisors and Weil divisors"></a>Cartier Divisors and Weil divisors</h4><p>It is an important question to determine the configuration of zeros and poles of a rational (or meromorphic) function. Let \(X\) be an integral scheme (i.e. reduced and irreducible). We denote by \(\mathcal K_X\) the constant sheaf on \(X\) with value the function field \(K(X)\) of \(X\). </p><blockquote><p>Definition. A Cartier divisor on \(X\) is a family \((U_i,f_i)\) where \((U_i)_i\) is an open cover of \(X\) and \(f_i\in K(X)^\times\) with \(f_if_j^{-1}\in \Gamma(U_i\cap U_j,\mathcal O_X^\times) \) for all \(i,j\), where two families \((U_i,f_i)\), \((V_i,g_i)\) give rise to the same Cariter divisor if \(f_ig_j^{-1}\in\Gamma(U_i\cap V_j,\mathcal O_X^\times)\) for all \(i,j\). The Cartier divisors form an abelian group \(\mathrm{Div}(X)\), where adding the family \((U_i,f_i)\) and \((V_i,g_i)\) gives \((U_i\cap V_j,f_ig_j)\). A Cartier divisor is principle if it is given by some \((X,f)\), and two divisors \(D,E\) are linearly equivalent if \(D-E\) is principle. </p></blockquote><p>Alernatively, we can set \(\mathrm{Div}(X)=\Gamma(X,\mathcal K_X^\times/\mathcal O_X^\times)\), and principle divisors the ones in the image of \(\Gamma(X,\mathcal K_X^\times)\). We call the ones in \(\Gamma(X,(\mathcal K_X^\times\cap \mathcal O_X)/\mathcal O_X^\times)\) effective divisors and denote it by \(D\ge 0\). Let \(\mathrm{Cl}(X)\) denote \(\mathrm{Div}(X)\) modulo the principle divisors, which we call the divisor class group. We have<br>\[1\longrightarrow \Gamma(X,\mathcal O_X)^\times\longrightarrow K(X)\longrightarrow \mathrm{Div}(X) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}(X)\longrightarrow 0\] a short exact sequence. To a Cartier divisor \(D\), we associate the line bundle \(\mathcal O_X(D)\)<br>\[\Gamma(V,\mathcal O_X(D))=\{f\in K(X): \forall i,f_if\in \Gamma(U_i\cap V,\mathcal O_X)\}\] for all open \(V\subseteq X\). This association \(D\mapsto \mathcal O_X(D)\) induces an isomorphism \(\mathrm{Cl}(X)\cong \mathrm{Pic}(X)\). Call an invertible \(\mathcal O_X\)-submodule of \(\mathcal K_X\) an invertible fractional ideal of \(\mathcal O_X\). Then we can associate a Cartier divisor \(D\) an invertible fractional ideal \(\mathcal F_X(D)\) such that \(\mathcal F_X(D) (U_i)=f_i\mathcal O_X\). This correspondance provides an isomorphism between \(\mathrm{Div}(X)\) and the invertible fractional ideal on \(X\). Cartier divisors considered more geometrically is so called Weil divisors. Let \(Z^k(X)\) be the free abelian group generated on the set of closed integral subscheme of codimension \(k\). The elements of \(Z^1(X)\) are then called Weil divisors and their generators called the prime divisors, and the ones with nonnegative coefficients are called the effective Weil divisors. We now connect Weil divisors with Cartier divisors with a homomorphism \(\mathrm{cyc}: \mathrm{Div}(X)\rightarrow Z^1(X) \). To this end, we need to define, for a prime Weil divisor \(C\), the order \(\mathrm{ord}_C(f)\) for some meromorphic function \(f\in \Gamma(U,\mathcal K_X)\) where the generic point \(\xi\) of \(C\) is contained in \(C\). If the local ring \(\mathcal O_{X,C}=\mathcal O_{X,\xi}\) is a DVR, for example, when \(X\) is normal, then we can just set \(\mathrm{ord}_C(f)=\nu (f)\) the normalized discrete valuation of \(f\). In general, the local ring is a local noetherian ring of dimension \(1\). For a nonzero \(f\in \mathrm{Frac}(\mathcal O_{X,C})\) where \(f=a/b\) we set \(\mathrm{ord}_C(f)=\mathrm{lg}(\mathcal O_{X,C}/(a))-\mathrm{lg}(\mathcal O_{X,C}/(b))\). For a Cartier divisor \(D\), we choose some element of its atlas \((U_i,f_i)\) where \(\xi_C\in U_i\), and define \(\mathrm{ord}_C(D)=\mathrm{ord}_C(f_i)\), and then we can define \(\mathrm{cyc}(D)=\sum_C\mathrm{ord}_C(D)\left[C\right]\). This provides the desired correspondance. Like Cartier divisors, we can associate to each Weil divisor \(D\), a fractional ideal \(\mathcal L\) where<br>\[\Gamma(U,\mathcal L)=\{f\in \mathcal K_X(U): \mathrm{div}(f)+D\ge 0\}\] which is the same one as the one with the corresponding Cartier divisor. </p><h4 id="Torsors"><a href="#Torsors" class="headerlink" title="Torsors"></a>Torsors</h4><p>For a sheaf \(T\) on some \(X\) and a sheaf of groups \(G\) on \(X\), we say \(T\) is a \(G\)-torsor if \(G\) acts on \(T\) simply transitively and \(X\) has an open cover \((U_i)_i\) such that \(T(U_i)\) is nonempty for all \(i\). The sheaf cohomology \(H^1(X,G)\) classifies the \(G\)-torsors. For a locally free \(\mathcal O_X\)-module \(\mathcal E\) of rank \(n\). The sheaf \(\mathrm{Isom}(\mathcal O_X^n,\mathcal E)\) is a \(\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X)\)-torsor by \(\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X)(U)\) acts on \(\mathrm{Isom}(\mathcal O_X^n,\mathcal E)(U)\) by \(g\cdot u\mapsto u\circ g^{-1}\). We have a bijection between rank \(n\) vector bundles and \(H^1(X,\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X))\), so rank \(n\) vector bundles are identified with \(\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathcal O_X)\)-torsors. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Recall that for a topological space \(X\), a fibre bundle of fibres \(F\), where \(F\) is a topological space, is a topological space \(E\), with a surjective map \(\pi: E\rightarrow X\) such that for all \(x\in X\), exists an open nbhd \(x\in U\subseteq X\) such that there is a homeomorphism \(\varphi: \pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F\) such that \(\mathrm{pr}_U\circ \varphi=\pi|_{\pi^{-1}(U)}\) where \(\mathrm{pr}_U:U\times F\rightarrow U\) is the projection onto \(U\). Fibre bundles generalize vector bundles and covering spaces. In this post, we interpret this algebraically and generalize this notion to schemes. &lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to write down some of the things I’ve learned. In this post, we start from a review of presheaves of sets and simplicial sets, and then build towards the definition of an \(\infty\)-category. Let \(A\) be a category, recall a presheaf on \(A\) is a contravariant functor \(X:A^{\mathrm{op}}\rightarrow \mathbf{Set}\), where we denote \(X_a=X(a)\) and \(u^*:b\rightarrow a\) the induced morphism for each \(u:a\rightarrow b\). And the category of presheaves on \(A\) is denoted as \(\widehat{A}\). The category of elements \(\int_AX\) (or \(\int X\)) is the category where objects are \((a,s)\) where \(a\in A\) and \(s\in X_a\), and a morphisms \(u:(a,s)\rightarrow (b,t)\) is a morphism \(u:a\rightarrow b\) where \(u^*(t)=s\). It comes equipped with a faithful functor \(\varphi_X:\int_A X\rightarrow \widehat{A}\) given by \((a,s)\mapsto \mathscr{H}_a\) on objects and \(u\mapsto \mathscr{H}(u)\) on morphisms, where \(\mathscr{H}:A\rightarrow \widehat{A}\) is the Yoneda embedding. In this post, we ignore all set-theoretic size issues. </p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Presheaves"><a href="#Presheaves" class="headerlink" title="Presheaves"></a>Presheaves</h4><p>First, we prove a variation of the Yoneda lemma (the coend calculus version).</p><blockquote><p>Theorem. The cocone defined by the collection of maps \(s:\mathscr{H}_a\rightarrow X\) for \((a,s)\in \int_AX\) (identifying via Yoneda lemma) exhibits \(X\) as a colimit of \(\varphi_X\) viewed as a diagram, that is, \(X=\mathrm{colim}\ \varphi_X\).<br><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>Let \(Y\) be a presheaf on \(A\). By the Yoneda lemma \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\widehat{A}}(\mathscr{H}_a,Y)\cong Y_a\), so a cocone from \(\varphi_X\) to \(Y\) can be viewed as a collection of sections \(f_s\in Y_a\) for \((a,s)\in \int_AX\) such that \(u^*(f_t)=f_s\) for all \(u:(a,s)\rightarrow (b,t)\). This means the collection of maps \(X_a\rightarrow Y_a\) by \(s\mapsto f_s\) is a morphism of presheaves. Hence, the map \(\Phi: \mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\rightarrow (\varphi_X\downarrow Y)\) given by composition with \(s:\mathscr{H}_a\rightarrow X\) for \((a,s)\in \int_AX\) has a two-sided inverse, therefore we have \(X=\mathrm{colim}\varphi_X\).</p>    </div></div></p></blockquote><p>Let \(C\) be a category with limits.

By this version of Yoneda lemma, we have the following consequence.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem. (Kan) The functor \(u^*:C\rightarrow \widehat{A}\) has left ajoint \(u_{!}:\widehat{A}\rightarrow C\). Moreover, there exists a natural isomorphism \(u(a)\xrightarrow{\sim} u_{!}(\mathscr{H}_a)\) for \(a\in A\), such that for any \(Y\in C\), the induced bijection \[\mathrm{Hom}_C(u(a),Y)\xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{Hom}_C(\mathscr{H}_a,Y)\] is the inverse of the composition \[\mathrm{Hom}_C(u(a),Y)=u^*(Y)_a\xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{Hom}_{\widehat{A}}(\mathscr{H}_a,u^*(Y))\xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{Hom}_C(u_!(\mathscr{H}_a), Y)<br>\] of the Yoneda equivalence with the adjunction formula. </p></blockquote><h4 id="Simplicial-Sets"><a href="#Simplicial-Sets" class="headerlink" title="Simplicial Sets"></a>Simplicial Sets</h4><p>Let \(\Delta\) be the category where the objects are finite sets \([n]=\{0,\dots,n\}\) for \(n\in\mathbb N\), and the morphisms are order preserving functions, called the <em>simplex category</em>. A <em>simplicial set</em> is a presheaf on \(\Delta\), and we denote the category of simplicial sets by \(\mathbf{SSet}=\widehat{\Delta}\). For \(n\in\mathbb N\), denote \(\Delta^n=\mathscr{H}_n\) as the <em>standard \(n\)-simplex</em>. For a simplicial set \(X\), we write \(X_n=X([n])=\mathrm{Hom}(\Delta^n,X)\) the set of <em>\(n\)-simplices</em> of \(X\). For integer \(n\ge 1\) and \(0\le i\le n\), the map \(\partial^n_i:\Delta^{n-1}\rightarrow \Delta^n\) corresponds to the map \([n-1]\rightarrow [n]\) where the value \(i\) is not taken, and for \(n\ge 0\), the map \(\sigma^n_i:\Delta^{n+1}\rightarrow \Delta^n\) corresponds to the map \([n+1]\rightarrow [n]\) that takes the value \(i\) twice. We also write \(d^i_n=(\partial_i^n)^*:X_n\rightarrow X_{n-1}\) and \(s^i_n=(\sigma_i^n)^*:X_n\rightarrow X_{n+1}\). The category \(\Delta\) is uniquely captured by a set of identities involving these operations. There is a geometric realization functor \(|\cdot|:\mathbf{SSet}\rightarrow \mathbf{Top}\) where \(\mathbf{Top}\) is the category of compactly generated Hausdorff topological spaces, given by</p><p>\[|\Delta^n|=\left\{(x_j)_{0\le j\le n}\in\mathbb R^{n+1}_{\ge 0}: \sum_{j=0}^n x_j= 1\right\}\] and \(|X|=\mathrm{colim}_{\Delta^n\rightarrow X}|\Delta^n|\) for a simplicial set \(X\). For each \(f:[m]\rightarrow [n]\), we get an associated continuous map \(|f|:|\Delta^m|\rightarrow |\Delta^n|\), defined by \(|f|(x_0,\dots,x_m)=(y_0,\dots,y_n)\) where \(y_j=\sum_{f(i)=j}x_i\). By virtue of the preceeding theorem, we have singular complex functor \(\mathrm{Sing}:\mathbf{Top}\rightarrow\mathbf{SSet}\), given by \(Y\mapsto \left[[n]\mapsto \mathrm{Hom}(|\Delta^n|,Y)\right]\) which is right adjoint to the geometric realization functor, i.e. \(|\cdot|\dashv \mathrm{Sing}\)</p><blockquote><p>Definition.

There’s the absolute Frobenius, the relative Frobenius, the arithmetic Frobenius, the geometric Frobenius… It’s a huge mess of concepts. So, I think it’ll probably benefit me to write an article elucidating these ideas. Our task is to generalize the Frobenius endomorphism \(\mathrm{Frob}_R:R\rightarrow R\) defined by \(x\mapsto x^p\) for a commutative ring \(R\) of characteristic \(p\) (recall \(\mathrm{Frob}_{\mathbb F_{p^n}}\) generates the Galois group \(\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb F_{p^n}/\mathbb F_p)\)), to the more general case of an endomorphism of a scheme of characteristic \(p\). We begin by defining the absolute Frobenius, and show that it has some undesirable properties, which prompts us to make modifications.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition. Let \(X\) be a scheme of characteristic \(p&gt;0\). The <em>absolute Frobenius endomorphism</em> \(\mathrm{Frob}_X:X\rightarrow X\) (sometimes written as \(F_X\)) is defined as the identity on the topological space, and \(\mathrm{Frob}_X^{\flat }\) is given by the usual Frobenius \(\mathrm{Frob}_A\) for each open affine \(\mathrm{Spec}(A)=U\subseteq X\). </p></blockquote><p>This seems to be a natural generalization, but we run into the problem that for an \(S\)-scheme \(f:X\rightarrow S\), we have \(\mathrm{Frob}_X\) is in general not an \(S\)-scheme morphism. For example, take \(X=S=\mathrm{Spec}(A)\) where \(A=\mathbb F_{p^2}\) with identity as the structure map. Note that \(\mathrm{Frob}_{A}\) is not a \(A\)-algebra morphism, hence \(\mathrm{Frob}_X\) is not an \(S\)-morphism. Thus, this motivates us to define a relative variant. Let \(f:X\rightarrow S\) be an \(S\)-scheme, consider the diagram <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMSwxLCJYXnsocCl9Il0sWzIsMSwiWCJdLFsxLDIsIlMiXSxbMiwyLCJTIl0sWzAsMCwiWCJdLFswLDIsImZeeyhwKX0iXSxbMSwzLCJmIiwyXSxbMCwxLCJcXHNpZ21hX1giXSxbMiwzLCJGX1MiXSxbNCwwLCJGX3tYL1N9IiwwLHsibGFiZWxfcG9zaXRpb24iOjYwLCJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XSxbNCwyLCJmIiwyLHsiY3VydmUiOjJ9XSxbNCwxLCJGX1giLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTJ9XV0=&embed" width="300" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> where \(X^{(p)}=X\times_S S\) is the base change of \(X\) by the Frobenius (as in Cartesian square in the diagram), and \(F_{X/S}=\mathrm{Frob}_{X/S}:X\rightarrow X^{(p)}\) is the unique morphism for the diagram to commute i.e. defined by the universal property, called the <em>relative Frobenius</em> of \(X\) over \(S\). For example, take \(A\) a ring of characteristic \(p\), \(R\) a finitely presented algebra over \(A\), and \(X=\mathrm{Spec}R\), then \(X^{(p)}=\mathrm{Spec}(R\otimes_{A,F_A} A)\), which is an extension of scalars. Therefore if \(R=A[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(f_1,\dots,f_m)\) then \(R^{(p)}\cong A[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(f_1^{(p)},\dots,f_m^{(p)})\) where \(f^{(p)}=\sum_\alpha s_\alpha^p X^\alpha\) for \(f=\sum_\alpha s_\alpha X^\alpha\), and \(X=\mathrm{Spec}(R^{(p)})\). The morphism \(\sigma_X^*\) is induced by the endomorphism \(f \mapsto f^{(p)}\) on \(A[X_1,\dots,X_n]\), and the morphism \(F_{X/S}^*=\mathrm{Frob}_{X/S}^*\) is induced by the endmorphism of \(A\)-algebras \(X_i\mapsto X_i^p\) on \(A[X_1,\dots,X]\). </p><blockquote><p>Theorem.

&lt;p&gt;The Frobenius endomorphism of schemes confuses the hell out of me. There’s the absolute Frobenius, the relative Frobenius, the arithmetic Frobenius, the geometric Frobenius… It’s a huge mess of concepts. So, I think it’ll probably benefit me to write an article elucidating these ideas. Our task is to generalize the Frobenius endomorphism \(\mathrm{Frob}_R:R\rightarrow R\) defined by \(x\mapsto x^p\) for a commutative ring \(R\) of characteristic \(p\) (recall \(\mathrm{Frob}_{\mathbb F_{p^n}}\) generates the Galois group \(\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb F_{p^n}/\mathbb F_p)\)), to the more general case of an endomorphism of a scheme of characteristic \(p\). We begin by defining the absolute Frobenius, and show that it has some undesirable properties, which prompts us to make modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is – insofar as it is thinkable at all – primitive and muddled.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Albert Einstein </p></blockquote><p>Epistemology is a branch of philosophy which studies knowledge. It concerns problems such as: how is knowledge defined (what does it mean to know something)? What is the value of knowledge? What is the structure of knowledge? I became interested in epistemology recently and have started reading Duncan Pritchard’s introductory text <em>What is This Thing Called Knowledge?</em> I can’t help but want to write down some of the things I’ve learned from my reading. In this post, I will talk about some key ideas from  Pritchard’s book.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="The-Problem-of-Criterion"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Criterion" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Criterion"></a>The Problem of Criterion</h4><p>When we think about what we know, we usually think about one of two kinds of knowledge: 1. <em>propositional knowledge</em>, knowledge expressible with a proposition, such as “the sky is blue”, or 2. <em>ability knowledge</em>, such as the knowledge of how to swim. Henceforth, when talking about knowledge, we will always be referring to the former. It is agreed upon epistemologists that the two basic elements for one to posess a piece of knowledge are truth and belief: one should believe the knowledge and the knowledge itself should be true. However, these two conditions not sufficient. Knowledge is not merely true beliefs: one can have true beliefs completely by accident. Suppose that there is a doctor who diagnoses a patient by a toss of a coin. Suppose also that the coin toss happens to give the correct diagnoses, then does it follow that the doctor knows what is wrong with the patient? Obviously not. Thus, it is a problem for epistemologists to try and figure out what is needed to be added to give a satisfactory definition (i.e. criterion) of knowledge. However, anyone who wishes to define knowledge faces the an immediate problem. To know the criterion of knowledge we need to know all that we do know, but to know all that we do know requires us to know the criterion of knowledge itself. It’s a <em>Catch-22</em>. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_the_criterion"><em>problem of the criterion</em></a>. </p><ol><li>What do we know (what is the extent of our knowledge)?</li><li>How do we know (what is the criterion of knowledge)?</li></ol><p>Each of these two problems are impossible to answer without first answering the other. One approach seeks to answer the first question first – this is stance called <em>particularism</em>, advocated by Roderick Chisholm “we start with particular cases of knowledge and then from those we generalise and formulate criteria [which tell] us what it is for a belief to be epistemologically respectable.” The antithesis of this position is <em>methodism</em>, exemplified by René Descartes, which seeks to answer the second question first. This position states that it is possible, through philosophical reflection alone, to identify criterions of knowledge, and through which to identify instances of knowledge. This is the position taken by classical empiracists. There is also a third stance, skepticism, which proclaims that since it is impossible to answer one question without the other, we are unable to answer either question, and hence unable to justify any of our beliefs. </p><h4 id="Gettier-Cases"><a href="#Gettier-Cases" class="headerlink" title="Gettier Cases"></a>Gettier Cases</h4><p>A very natural methodist attempt to the problem of criterion, typically attributed to Plato, is to proclaim that knowledge are <em>justified</em> true beliefs, i.e. true beliefs with some good basis or grounds. This is the <em>tripartite theory of knowledge</em>. However, things are not that simple. The philosopher Edmund Gettier, in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949">a three-page article</a>, gave a list of devastating counter-examples to the tripartite theory, which we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem"><em>Gettier Cases</em></a>, showing that it is completely untenable. In essence, it shows that you could have a justified true belief but still lack knowledge because your true belief was gained by luck in the same way as the previous example of the doctor. </p><p>I will here paraphrase an example of such a case from Pritchard’s book. Imagine a man named, say, John, comes downstairs one morning and sees the clock on the living room says it’s 8 o’clock. On this basis, John believes it is 8 o’clock. John usually comes downstairs around this time, and the clock has been very realiable in the past, so John is justified in his belief. Suppose, however, it was unbeknownst to him that the clock had stopped precisely 12 hours ago. So John had a justified true belief which does not intuitively constitute knowledge – other Gettier cases more or less have the same structure as this example. Therefore, the tripartite account is insufficient for the criterion of knowledge (it is, however, agreed among epistemologists that the tripartite conditions are necessary for having knowledge). </p><p>It was at first believed that the Gettier cases could be amended by tweaking the tripartite condition, such as stipulating that the belief should be true, justified, and not based on false presuppositions. However, it is difficult to specify the meaning of “presuppositions”, e.g. you could have a justification of a true belief with a false presupposition. For example, John could have a friend Sally who looks at a working clock and thinks that the time is 8 o’clock, but she might justify this by presupposing the clock is regularly maintained, which happens to not be the case. Moreover, it is also not clear that a presuppoosition is needed at all. For example, suppose a farmer forms a belief that there is a sheep in the field by looking at a shaggy dog which looks like a sheep, but there actually is a sheep on the field, standing behind the dog. Thus, it is difficult to respond to Gettier cases. </p><h4 id="Agrippa’s-trilemma"><a href="#Agrippa’s-trilemma" class="headerlink" title="Agrippa’s trilemma"></a>Agrippa’s trilemma</h4><p>The nature of justification is enigmatic. Pick any belief for which you have a justification, then it still remains the question: what justifies the justification itself? And if we have a justification of that justification, what justifies it then? We could keep asking this question ad infinitum. Thus, we find ourselves in the following predicament called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma#Agrippa's_Trilemma">Agrippa’s trilemma</a> (or Münchhausen trilemma): in order to justify any statement, we must accept one of the following kind of arguments, each of which is unsatisfactory: </p><ol><li><em>circular argument</em>: the justification of a proposition presupposes itself,</li><li><em>regressive argument</em>: each justification requires a further justification ad infinitum,</li><li><em>dogmatic argument</em>: some statements are regarded as accepted precepts (merely asserted but not defended).</li></ol><p>Some philosophers embrace option 1, and proclaim that a circular chain of arguments can justify a claim, which is a position called <em>coherentism</em>. This is usually supplemented with the proviso that the circular chain must be large enough. Other philosophers embrace option 2, and proclaim that we can justify a claim by an infinite chain of arguments, which is a position called <em>infinitism</em>. The third position is to embrace option 3, and proclaim some beliefs are justified without without any further justification, which is a position known as <em>foundationalism</em> – the position taken in modern mathematics. The dominant foundationalist view states that some beliefs do not require further justification because there are self-justifying – this is known as <em>classical foundationalism</em>. An example of a classical foundationalist is Descartes. He argued that the foundations for our knowledge are those that immune to doubt and are hence self-evident. He gave the example of ones belief of ones own existance. I cannot doubt my own existance because for me to doubt – to think – requires my existing in the first place. Hence his famous line, “I think, therefore I am.”</p><h4 id="The-Problem-of-Perception"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Perception" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Perception"></a>The Problem of Perception</h4><p>A large portion of our knowledge comes from our senses, i.e. perceptual knowledge. We tend to think that our sensory faculties are reliable, but perceptual knowledge can deceive us. This is because fundamentally perceptions are an <em>indirect</em> way of gaining knowledge – our perceived reality could be hallucinations undetectable from reality. This is the <em>argument from illusion</em>. It is odd as it contradicts our intuitive sense that we are directly experiencing reality, hence we have a problem: could we ever directly directly perceive the physical world? This is the <em>problem of perception</em>.</p><p>One response to this problem is <em>indirect realism</em>, which embraces the apparent indirectness of our perception, and proclaims that we gain knowledge of the objective world by making inferences from our sense impressions. John Locke makes the distinction between primary and secondary qualities of an object perceived: a primary quality of an object is a quality independent of anyone perceiving the object e.g. shape, and a secondary quality is a quality dependent upon the perception of an object, e.g. color. Indirect realists use this notion to distinguish world-as-it-is and world-as-perceived. This view, however, threatens to dislocate ourselves from the world. Skeptics respond by the famous thought experiment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat"><em>brain in a vat</em></a>: how do we know whether our perceived reality is simulated with a supercomputer? This is the <em>problem of the external world</em>. How could I, in this case, infer anything at all about the objective world? Thus, there is no reason to assume so in the first place.</p><p>The view that denies there is a world independent of our experience is <em>idealism</em>, a famous exponent of which is George Berkeley. This position claims that perceptual knowledge is not knowledge of a world independent of perception, but knowledge of a world constituted by our perception of it. In this view, the world is constructed out of perception – “to be is to be perceived.” However, idealist typically don’t agree that the world cease to exist when no one is to perceive it. To avoid such dramatic consequence, Berkeley proclaims that there is a God who perceives everything, which does not convince me very much. Another version of idealism is <em>transcendental idealism</em> by Immanuel Kant. Kant argues that although what we perceive may not be the world itself, we are required to suppose that there is an external world which gives rise to such experience, without which we cannot make sense of it. This sounds like indirect realism, but it is idealism in the sense that Kant rejects the possibility of gaining knowledge independent of experience through experience at all, directly or not</p><h4 id="A-Priori-A-Posteriori-and-Problem-of-Induction"><a href="#A-Priori-A-Posteriori-and-Problem-of-Induction" class="headerlink" title="A Priori, A Posteriori, and Problem of Induction"></a>A Priori, A Posteriori, and Problem of Induction</h4><p>We distinguish between a priori knowledge, knowledge gained independent of empircal investigation, and a posteriori knowledge i.e. empircal knowledge. For example, an important variety of a priori knowledge is introspection – the examination of one’s own psychology. All proposition that one could have a priori knowledge of, one could also have a posteriori knowledge of. From these knowledge, we could infer more with argument. The general types of arguments are: deduction, induction, abduction, analogy and fallacy. Inductive arguments infer from a large number of a posteriori knowledge, the sample, a general claim that goes beyond the sample. David Hume raised the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction"><em>problem of induction</em></a> which questions whether inductive arguments are justified. There seem that the only way to justify inductive arguments is by further use of the argument – by observing the correlation between observed regularity in a large sample and unrestricted regularity. The justification of the inductive inference is circular. Some respond to the problem by claiming it is a fundamental epistemic practice, and some claim that it does not matter as long as inductive arguments work, but those defenses are hardly intellectually satisfying. </p><p>Karl Popper’s response to this problem is <em>critical rationalism</em>: inductive inference are never used in science, instead they conjecture hypotheses, deductively infer consequences from them, and empiracally try to falsify the consequences. Therefore, scientists in fact use deductive inferences rather than inductive inferences. There are some problems with this position. One problem is in this view, we do not actually know the generalizations that scientists make, but only the falsity of the falsified theories. This would mean we don’t know that the “correct” scientific theories are true, only that they have not been falsified yet. Another problem is that it is not clear how much counter evidence is needed to falsify a claim. If it is been observed for many years that emus are flightless, then a testimony that one has seen a flying emus does not necessarily constitude enough evidence to falsify that claim. An alternative approach is given by Hans Reichenbach’s <em>pragmatism</em>. Reichenbach agrees that there is no justification for inductive reference, but it is pragmatic to use it since it gives us a lot of true beliefs of the world, thus it is nevertheless a rational thing to do. </p><h4 id="Problem-of-Other-Minds"><a href="#Problem-of-Other-Minds" class="headerlink" title="Problem of Other Minds"></a>Problem of Other Minds</h4><p>We take for granted that other people have minds like we do, but this is not entirely obvious. We cannot observe other minds like we observe objects, and we cannot experience other’s perspective like we experience our own either. Thus, there is skepticism to whether other people also have the first person experience like <em>I</em> do. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_other_minds"><em>problem of other minds</em></a></p><p>The most famous response is from John Stuart Mill, who make use of inductive reasoning. I observe that the behaviors of others mirror our own, from this I inductively infer that they have minds like I do. This is the <em>argument from analogy</em>. There are problems with this argument as well. In the 1956 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049366/"><em>Invasion of the Body-Snatchers</em></a>, aliens quitely replace real people but they act and behave just like regular people, but they do not experience the world as we do. This points out the flaw in the argument from analogy: we cannot be sure just by observing behavior. In this argument, we could infer that things, such as a highly advanced robot, has a mind, when it is not clear if it is true. A series of videos on this topic (in Chinese) can be found <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1D94y1m7Ft/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=54d0c49d785d283eeaaec59f84aebba4">here</a>.</p><h4 id="Radical-Skeptical-Paradox"><a href="#Radical-Skeptical-Paradox" class="headerlink" title="Radical Skeptical Paradox"></a>Radical Skeptical Paradox</h4><p>A skeptical hypothesis is a scenario whereby one is severely deceived about the world but unable to detect such deception. In epistemology, skeptical hypotheses are used as a litmus test for any theory of knowledge. Thus skepticism is seen as a methodological devil’s advocate. This gives rise to the <em>radical skeptical paradox</em>: since we are unable to know the denials of skeptical hypotheses, we are unable to know anything of substance at all about the world. There is a lot more about this topic, but I’m tired and I think I will stop here. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“The rules of go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play go. “</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Edward Lasker </p></blockquote><p>The game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> is an ancient and profound abstract strategy board game that I, albeit losing most of my games, enjoy playing very much. If you have not heard of Go before, see <a href="https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go">here</a> for a quick guide to the rules of Go. I’ve been recently designing my own variant of Go, which I call “Terrain Go” tentatively for lack of a better name. This variant is inspired by Bobby Fischer’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess">Fischer random chess</a>, which is a chess variant that, at the outset of the game, randomizes the initial positions of pieces at the players’ home ranks in a certain way that preserves the dynamic nature of the game. The variant is designed to “eliminate the complete dominance of openings preparation in classical chess, replacing it with creativity and talent.” In a similar spirit, we introduce randomness at the outset of Go by way of “terrain”, in a way that preserves the dynamic nature of Go.</p><span id="more"></span><h4 id="Rules"><a href="#Rules" class="headerlink" title="Rules"></a>Rules</h4><p>At the beginning of the game, each intersection on the 19 by 19 board will be assigned one of the following types</p><ul><li>Mountain, indicated by a triangle \(\Delta\)</li><li>Water, indicated by a square \(\square\)</li><li>Plains, with no indication</li></ul><p>and they are generated randomly in a way such that each group of \(\Delta\) or \(\square\) does not surround empty intersections, and that there are exactly 60 in 2 to 4 groups of each \(\Delta\) or \(\square\), each group having at least 12 stones. Therefore, 60 intersections are mountain, 60 intersections are water, and 240 intersections are plains. In classical Go, with area scoring, each intersection is worth 1 point. However, in Terrain Go, each \(\Delta\) is worth 0 point, each \(\square\) is worth 1.5 points, and each plain is worth 1 point. Additionally, at the beginning, players will take turns placing 3 markings each, called their “forts”, on a “plain” intersection of their choice, which will be indicated by letters. They will each be worth 12 points for the opponent if at the end of the game they end up in the oppoent’s territory (and 0 if it ends up in their own), and once placed, they cannot be captured or removed from the board, or occupied by a stone, or serve as a liberty for another group. Here’s an example of a configuration of the board, where A, B, C are white’s forts, and C, D, E are black’s.</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/goconfig.png" alt="Example Configuration" style="height: 560px; width: 560px;"></p><p>The game will begin with the player who played second in placing the marking, and the rules of capture and Ko, etc, will all follow that of classical Go with the area scoring described above. Additionally, there are special rules for placing stones at moutain or water areas:</p><ol><li>A stone can only be placed at an intersection marked as \(\Delta\) if it will be a part of a group that has at least 1 liberty outside; </li><li>a stone can only be placed at an intersection marked as \(\square\) if it will be a part of a group that has at least 1 stone outside. </li></ol><p>Since the initial position is randomized, we wouldn’t be able to know the appropriate komi, so the initial positions must be checked by an AI program to make sure it is relatively fair for both players, compensating with a small komi for black or white if necessary. </p><h4 id="New-Tactics-and-Strategies"><a href="#New-Tactics-and-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="New Tactics and Strategies"></a>New Tactics and Strategies</h4><p>An obvious consequence of the new rules is that any Joseki/Fuseki are rendered obsolete, thus the player cannot obtain any advantage by pre-memorizing openings. The uneven distribution of value of intersections could also lead to interesting strategies. This is arguably closer to real-life war, in which not all areas are of equal strategic value. I would also imagine that it is probably good strategy to start the game around the forts, which are the most valuable positions. In addition, the special rules for placing stones at mountains and waters could lead to novel life and death situations and local tactics. It is more difficult to traverse water because a stone cannot jump in the water alone, it must connect to an existing group that bridges to land. It is even more difficult to traverse mountains since the opponent could try to eliminate outside liberties easily. Therefore, it is possible, for example, to imagine a position where a group of stones is sorrounded “against” a group of mountains or waters. The reader is welcomed to think about more tactics unique to this variant.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“The introduction of the cipher 0 or the group concept was general nonsense too, and mathematics was more or less stagnating for thousands of years because nobody was around to take such childish steps.” </p><p style="text-align: right;"> Alexander Grothendieck </p></blockquote><p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3072368">paper</a> by Dan Isaksen, which I find very interesting. It shows that even incredibly basic math, such as the way we learned to add integers in elementary school, could be seen from a much deeper and beautifully illuminating light of group cohomology. The original paper is very accessibe, but I still wanted to share this with you in my own exposition. We begin by revisiting the classic  algorthim for adding and subtracting non-negative whole numbers: we align the numbers vertically, we do the operation digit-by-digit, and carrying a \(1\) when the digits add to \(10\) or more. The “carrying” here is the essence, we will see that this could be interpreted as 2-cocycles in a certain group cohomology.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition. Suppose \(Q,N\) are two groups, then an extension group of \(Q\) by \(N\) is a group \(G\) along with a short exact sequence of groups \[\mathbb{1}\rightarrow N \xrightarrow{\  i\ } G\xrightarrow{\ \pi\ }Q\rightarrow \mathbb{1}\]i.e. we have (the image of) \(N\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\) and \(G/N\cong Q\). The extension is said to be a central extension if \(N\) lies in the center of \(G\), a cyclic extension if \(G\) is cyclic, and a split extension if the exact sequence splits, i.e. there exists a map \(\tau:Q\rightarrow G\) such that \(\pi\circ \tau=\mathrm{id}\) (this is a proper generalization of split exact sequences in the category of abelian groups).</p></blockquote><p>The archetypical example in this article is the following. Let \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\) be our simplified model of the classic addition algorithm, which captures carrying from the ones digit to the tens digit, so it will suffice for our purpose. Let \(T\) be the subgroup of \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\) consisting of multiples of \(10\), which we call “tens”, and \(O\) be the quotient group of \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\) by \(T\) which we call the “ones”. Obviously \(T\cong \mathbb Z/10\mathbb Z\cong O\), but we note that they have different relationships to \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\). We then have a short exact sequence \(\mathbb{1}\rightarrow T \hookrightarrow \mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\xrightarrow{\ \pi\ }O\rightarrow \mathbb{1}\), viewed as a group extension. This extension is central, cyclic, but not split. </p><p>In the following, we will work more generally with an arbitrary extension \(G\) of \(Q\) by \(N\), where all these groups are assumed abelian and written additively. We pick a set-theoretic map \(\tau:Q\rightarrow G\) s.t. \(\pi\circ\tau=\mathrm{id}\) and \(\tau(0)=0\), and then we have a (set-theoretic) bijective correspondance \(G\leftrightharpoons N\times Q\) given by \[G\ \xrightleftharpoons[(n,q)\mapsto n+\tau(q)]{g\mapsto (g-\tau(\pi(g)),\pi(g))}\ N\times Q\]</p><p>Bijectivity is easily verified. In the case of the archetypical example, this bijective correspondance \(\mathbb Z/100\mathbb Z\leftrightharpoons T\times O\) separates the tens and ones digit, e.g. \(14\mapsto (10,4)\), when \(\tau\) is appropriately chosen. We can then express the new addition function in this form, we could easily calculate as \[(n_1,q_1)+(n_2,q_2)=(n_1+n_2+z(q_1,q_2), q_1+q_2)\] where \(z(q_1,q_2)=\tau(q_1)+\tau(q_2)-\tau(q_1+q_2)\), which we call the carrying function. In the case of our example, we have e.g. \(z(6,7)=10\) and \(z(4,5)=0\), when \(\tau\) is appropriately chosen. More generally,</p><blockquote><p>Definition. We say that a function \(z:Q\times Q\rightarrow N\) is a carrying function if it satisfies </p><ol><li>(cocycle condition) \(z\left(b, c\right)-z\left(a+b, c\right)+z\left(a, b+c\right)-z\left(a, b\right)=0\)</li><li>(normalization condition) \(z(a,0)=z(0,a)=0\)</li></ol></blockquote><p>We can verify that \(z(q_1,q_2)=\tau(q_1)+\tau(q_2)-\tau(q_1+q_2)\) does satisfy these two conditions. The cocycle condition is derived from the associativity of addition, and the normalization condition is easily verified. Conversely, given two abelian groups \(N,Q\) and a (set-theoretic) carrying function \(z:Q\times Q\rightarrow N\), the set \(N\times Q\) with addition \((n_1,q_1)+(n_2,q_2)=(n_1+n_2+z(q_1,q_2), q_1+q_2)\) is a well-defined abelian group. Let \(G\) be this group, then \(G\) is a group extension of \(Q\) by \(N\) in the obvious way. For example, let \(Q=O\) and \(N=T\), and let the carrying function carry 2 when it normally carries 1, then we get the group \(G=\mathbb Z/50\oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z\).</p><p>We saw that an extension gives a carrying function, and a carrying function gives rise to an extension. This correspondance is, however, not bijective. An isomorphism of extension is \(\phi:G\rightarrow G^\prime\) which restricts to the identity map on \(N\rightarrow N^\prime\) and induces isomorphism \(Q\rightarrow Q^\prime\), i.e. an isomorphism must preserve \(N\) and \(Q\). We then have the following</p><blockquote><p>Theorem. Suppose \(G,G^\prime\) are extensions with induced carrying functions \(z,z^\prime\), then TAFE</p><ol><li><p>exists a function \(h:Q\rightarrow N\) s.t. for all \(q_1,q_2\in Q\) \[z(q_1,q_2)-z^\prime(q_1,q_2)=h(q_1)+h(q_2)-h(q_1+q_2)\] and satisfies \(h(0)=0\) </p></li><li><p>\(G\cong G^\prime\) as extensions.</p></li></ol><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>In one direction, define isomorphism \(\phi:G\rightarrow G^\prime\) by \(\phi(n,q)=(n+h(q),q)\), and the rest is a routine check. In the other direction, define \(h\) by the formula \(\phi(0,q)=(h(q),q)\). Then we compare the first component of \(\phi(0,q_1)+\phi(0,q_2)=\phi((0,q_1)+(0,q_2))\)</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>This gives us motivation to link this to group cohomology. We note that the carrying functions are precisely the 2-cocycles, and the RHS are the 2-coboundaries in the group cohomology \(H^2(Q;N)=\operatorname{Ext}^1_{\mathbb{Z}}(Q, N)\). Where \(N\) is a \(Q\)-module acting by conjugation. We can write out explicitly the coboundary map \(d^{2}: C^1(Q, N) \rightarrow C^{2}(Q, N)\) by \((dh)(q_1,q_2)=h(q_1)+h(q_2)-h(q_1+q_2)\), which checks out comparing to the previous calculations. </p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3072368&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Isaksen, which I find very interesting. It shows that even incredibly basic math, such as the way we learned to add integers in elementary school, could be seen from a much deeper and beautifully illuminating light of group cohomology. The original paper is very accessibe, but I still wanted to share this with you in my own exposition. We begin by revisiting the classic  algorthim for adding and subtracting non-negative whole numbers: we align the numbers vertically, we do the operation digit-by-digit, and carrying a \(1\) when the digits add to \(10\) or more. The “carrying” here is the essence, we will see that this could be interpreted as 2-cocycles in a certain group cohomology.&lt;/p&gt;

Before we actually do that, we need to introduce localization of categories, and we will define the derived category in terms of a localization of the homotopy category of complexes. Localization of categories is very analogous to localization of rings or modules. Given any category (with no assumption of abelian, additive, triangulated, etc), we formally invert a class of morphisms. We will give one definition in terms of a localization construction and show that it is unsatisfactory in that it does not have a lot of useful and desirable properties. We will then develop a better description of derived categories in terms of roofs.</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition 1. Let \(\mathcal A\) be a category and \(S\) a class of morphisms of it, then define its localization as a category \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) and a functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow A[S^{-1}]\) s.t. \(Q(s)\) is an isomorphism for all \(s\in S\) and \(Q\) is universal w.r.t. this property, i.e. if the functor \(F:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is such that \(F(s)\) is an isomorphism for each \(s\), then there exists a unique functor \(G:\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\rightarrow\mathcal B\) s.t. \(F=G\circ Q\). </p></blockquote><p>The way we obtain a construction that satisfies this universal property is quite convoluted. We define it this way. Let \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) have the same objects as \(\mathcal A\). For each \(X,Y\in\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\), let a directed edge between them be a morphism \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\) or if \(s\in S\cap \mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\), an edge in the opposite direction \(s:Y\rightarrow X\). A path between two objects \(M,N\in A[S^{-1}]\) is a sequence of directed edges \(M=L_0, L_1,\dots,L_n=N\), where the direction does not need to be the same. We define \(\mathrm{Hom}(M,N)\) as the equivalence class of paths where two paths are equivalent if they can be transformed to each other via a sequence of the following transformations.</p><ol><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{f}Y\xrightarrow{g}Z\), replace with \(X\xrightarrow{gf}Z\),</li><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{s} Y\xleftarrow{s}X\) where \(s\in S\), replace with \(X\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_X} X\),</li><li>for \(Y\xleftarrow{s} X\xrightarrow{s}Y\) where \(s\in S\), replace with \(Y\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_Y} Y\),</li><li>for \(X\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_X}X\xleftarrow{s} Y\), replace with \(X\xleftarrow{s}Y\)</li></ol><p>Long story short, this is a well defined equivalence relation, so it forms a category where composition is concatonation. For the localization functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A[S^{-1}]\), it sends objects to themselves, and morphisms to the equivalence class with the path being the single morphism. Here we should give extra care that the arrows can some times mean directed edges, and is \(Y\leftarrow X\) can mean a path from \(Y\) to \(X\), only with the directed edge in the opposite direction. We can verify that this indeed satisfies the universal property of localization. We may also check that by this localization construciton, one can write morphisms in the form \[\left(Q\left(f_1\right) \circ Q\left(s_1\right)^{-1}\right) \circ \cdots \circ\left(Q\left(f_n\right) \circ Q\left(s_n\right)^{-1}\right)\] where \(s_i\in S\).

A morphism \(Q(f)\circ Q(s)^{-1}\) in \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\) is represented by a left roof, which is a diagram \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\), and a morphism \(Q(t)^{-1}\circ Q(g)\) with \(t\in S\) is represented by a right roof which is a diagram \(M\xrightarrow{g}L\xleftarrow{t}N\). We say that the two left roofs \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\) and \(M\xleftarrow{t}K\xrightarrow{g}N\) are equivalent if there exists \(p:H\rightarrow L\) and \(q:H\rightarrow K\) such that \(sp,tq\in S\) and the diagram <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNSxbMiwwLCJIIl0sWzEsMSwiTCJdLFszLDEsIksiXSxbMCwyLCJNIl0sWzQsMiwiTiJdLFswLDEsInAiLDJdLFswLDIsInEiXSxbMSwzLCJzIiwyXSxbMiw0LCJnIl0sWzIsMywidCJdLFsxLDQsImYiLDJdXQ==&embed" width="350" height="250" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> commutes. We can show that this is an equivalence relation. The only difficult part is transitivity. This can be done using a diagram chasing argument. We can also define composition of roofs. The composition of the previous two roofs is defined as a composition of the diagram <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNixbMiwwLCJVIl0sWzEsMSwiTCJdLFszLDEsIksiXSxbMCwyLCJNIl0sWzIsMiwiTiJdLFs0LDIsIlAiXSxbMCwxLCJsIiwyXSxbMCwyLCJrIl0sWzEsMywicyIsMl0sWzEsNCwiZiJdLFsyLDQsInQiLDJdLFsyLDUsImciXV0=&embed" width="350" height="250" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> where \(U\) and the associated maps are induced from the fact that \(S\) is a localizing class. We could check that these satisfies all the desirable properties of a composition. Composition respects equivalence of roofs, is associative, and has an identity given by \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf{1}_M} M\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_M} M\). One can check that the category of (equivalence classes of) left roofs \(\mathcal A_S\) is equivalent to right roofs, so we might as well just work with left roofs. We define a functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A_S\) by letting it be identity on objects and for each morphism \(f:M\rightarrow N\), let \(Q(f)\) be the equivalence class of roofs \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf 1_M}M\xrightarrow{f} N\). This satisfies the universal property of localization, hence isomorphic to \(\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\).</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 2. For \(S\) a localizing class of category \(\mathcal A\), the category \(\mathcal A_S\) and functor \(Q:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal A_S\) satisfies the universal property of localization, i.e. \(Q(s)\) is an isomorphism for each \(s\in S\) and is universal w.r.t. it.</p><div class="spoiler collapsed">    <div class="spoiler-title">        Proof    </div>    <div class="spoiler-content">        <p>For the first property, \(M\xleftarrow{\mathbf{1}_M}M\xrightarrow{s}N\) has an inverse \(N\xleftarrow{s}M\xrightarrow{\mathbf{1}_M}M\). Next, suppose \(F:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal B\) is such that \(F(s)\) is an isomorphism for all \(s\in S\), define functor \(G:\mathcal A_S\rightarrow \mathcal B\) as identity on objects, and for morphisms, the following. If \(\phi:M\rightarrow N\) in \(\mathcal A_S\), choose a representing roof \(M\xleftarrow{s}L\xrightarrow{f}N\), and define \(G(\phi)=F(f)\circ F(s)^{-1}\). It’s not immediately obvious that this is well defined on equivalence classes, but we omit the verification. This obviously satisfies \(F=G\circ Q\). It is left to the reader to verify that \(G\) respects composition, which is the last piece of verification necessary.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>If \(\mathcal A\) is an additive category, then localizing it would also have an additive structure. In fact if \(\mathcal A\) is additive, we may restate the last axiom of localizing class as: for \(f:M\rightarrow N\) exists \(\exists s\in S, sf=0\Longleftrightarrow \exists t\in S, tf=0\). And the inherited additive structure is the obvious one. It is not trivial to check that it is well defined, but again we ommit the verification. Again everything works out as we expected, biproducts, zero objects are preserved, and localization functor is additive. We can also check that \(f=0\) in the localization iff exists \(t\in S\) with \(tf=0\) iff exists \(t\in S\) with \(ft=0\), and \(M=\mathbf 0\) in the localization iff exists \(N\in\mathcal A\) with \((N\xrightarrow{0}M)\in S\) iff exists \(N\in\mathcal A\) with \((M\xrightarrow{0}N)\in S\). These are easy to prove and left as an exercise. Similarly, one can show the localization of abelian categories is abelian. </p><p>Given a triangulated category, a natural question to ask is: when is a localization of it also triangulated?

For a localizing class \(S\) in the triangulated category \(\mathcal C\), the localization is compatible with triangulation if the following conditions hold</p><ol><li>for each morphism \(f\), we have \(f\in S\) iff \(f[1]\) in \(S\).</li><li>a diagram with \(s,t\in S\) and distinguished rows <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsOCxbMCwwLCJYIl0sWzEsMCwiWSJdLFsyLDAsIloiXSxbMywwLCJYWzFdIl0sWzAsMSwiWF5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzEsMSwiWV5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzIsMSwiWl5cXHByaW1lIl0sWzMsMSwiWF5cXHByaW1lWzFdIl0sWzAsNCwicyJdLFsxLDUsInQiXSxbMiw2LCJ1IiwwLHsic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV0sWzMsNywic1sxXSJdLFswLDFdLFsxLDJdLFsyLDNdLFs0LDVdLFs1LDZdLFs2LDddXQ==&embed" width="300" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> can be completed to a morphism of distinguished triangles. </li></ol><p>We can show that if these conditions hold then the localization \(\mathcal C[S^{-1}]\) inherits the triangulated structure \(QT_{\mathcal C}\), and a triangle is distinguished if it is isomorphic to an image of a distinguished triangle.

They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don’t really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories.

Every semisimple abelian category has a triangulated structure. To do this, we let the translation functor be the identity functor, and we declare a triangle \(X\xrightarrow{u} Y\xrightarrow{v} Z\xrightarrow{w} X\) distinguished if it is “exact” at \(X\), i.e. \(\mathrm{Ker}(u)=\mathrm{Im}(w)\). Verifying this is a triangulated category is a tedious, and we will not do it here. Moreover, all abelian triangulated categories are semisimple. We will not prove this either. In fact, the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\) is triangulated. To see this, we set the distinguished triangles to be the ones isomorphic to a standard triangle of the form \[X^\bullet\xrightarrow{f^\bullet} Y^\bullet \xrightarrow{i_f^\bullet} \mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\xrightarrow{p_f^\bullet} X^\bullet[1]\] and as expected, the cohomology functor \(H^n:K(\mathcal A)\rightarrow\mathcal A\) is cohomological.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Continuing last week where we defined the homotopy category of complexes, we will take a look at triangulated categories. This will help us build towards the definition of derived categories. In some sense, triangulated categories are approximations of abelian categories. They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don’t really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories. Instead of kernels, cokernels, and strict morphisms, triangulated categories bypass these notions and start out with “distinguished triangles”, which are similar to exact sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, I read from the wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry">homological mirror symmetry</a> that the derived category of coherent sheaves is a popular research topic in algebraic geometry. Also, I’ve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don’t understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\).</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>Definition 1.

An <em>additive functor</em> \(\mathcal F:\mathcal C\rightarrow\mathcal D\) between additive categories is a functor such that the associated map \(\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\rightarrow \mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal F(A),\mathcal F(B))\) is a group homomorphism for each \(A,B\in\mathcal C\). Moreover, we denote by \(0_{A,B}\) (or \(0\) if there is no confusion) the identity element of \(\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\).</p></blockquote><p>Note \(0_{A,B}\) is the zero morphism since it’s the unique morphism \(A\rightarrow B\) which factors through \(\mathbf 0\), i.e. \(A\rightarrow\mathbf 0\rightarrow B\).  In particular, note that \(0_{A,B}\circ f=0_{X,A}\) and \(g\circ 0_{A,B}=0_{B,X}\) for any \(f:X\rightarrow A\) and \(g:B\rightarrow X\), for any object \(X\). We note that equivalently, an additive functor maybe defined as a functor that preserves all finite biproducts.</p><p>We recall that in a category \(\mathcal C\), the equalizer \(\mathrm{Eq}(f,g)\) of morphisms \(f,g:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(E\in\mathcal C\) and a morphism \(e:E\rightarrow A\) s.t. the diagram \(E\rightarrow A\rightrightarrows B\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. Dually, the coequalizer \(\mathrm{Coeq}(f,g)\) is an object \(Q\in\mathcal C\) and a morphism \(q:B\rightarrow Q\) s.t. the diagram \( A\rightrightarrows B\rightarrow Q\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. In an additive category, for a morphism \(f:A\rightarrow B\), define its kernel \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)=\mathrm{Eq}(f,0_{A,B})\), cokernel \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)=\mathrm{Coeq}(f,0_{A,B})\). Spelled out explicitly, a kernel of \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(K\) and a morphism \(k:K\rightarrow A\) such that \(f\circ k=0_{K,B}\), and given any \(K^\prime\) and \(k^\prime:K^\prime\rightarrow A\) with \(f\circ k^\prime=0_{K^\prime,B}\), there exists unique \(u:K^\prime\rightarrow K\) s.t. \(k\circ u=k^\prime\).</p><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMSwwLCJBIl0sWzIsMCwiQiJdLFswLDAsIksiXSxbMCwxLCJLXlxccHJpbWUiXSxbMCwxLCJmIl0sWzIsMCwiayJdLFsyLDEsIjBfe0ssQn0iLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMywwLCJrXlxccHJpbWUiLDIseyJsYWJlbF9wb3NpdGlvbiI6NjB9XSxbMywxLCIwX3tLXlxccHJpbWUsQn0iLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6Mn1dLFszLDIsInUiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XV0=&embed" height="190" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe><p>Dually, a cokernel of \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an object \(Q\) with a morphism \(q:B\rightarrow Q\) with \(q\circ f=0_{A,Q}\), such that for any object \(Q^\prime\) and morphism \(q^\prime:B\rightarrow Q\) with \(q^\prime\circ f=0_{A,Q^\prime}\), there exists unique \(u:Q\rightarrow Q^\prime\) such that \(q^\prime=u\circ q\).</p><iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJBIl0sWzEsMCwiQiJdLFsyLDAsIlEiXSxbMiwxLCJRXlxccHJpbWUiXSxbMCwxLCJmIl0sWzEsMiwicSJdLFsxLDMsInFeXFxwcmltZSIsMl0sWzIsMywidSIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImJvZHkiOnsibmFtZSI6ImRhc2hlZCJ9fX1dLFswLDIsIjBfe0EsUX0iLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMCwzLCIwX3tBLFFeXFxwcmltZX0iLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6Mn1dXQ==&embed" height="190" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe><p>Recall a subobject of an object \(X\) is an object \(A\) with a monomorphism \(A\hookrightarrow X\), and a quotient object of \(X\) is an object \(Q\) with an epimorphism \(X\twoheadrightarrow Q\).

In fact, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell%27s_embedding_theorem">Freyd–Mitchell embedding theorem</a> states that any abelian category can be embedded to the category of \(R\)-modules for some \(R\) via a fully faithful functor. So we may use element-wise diagram chasing in abelian categories, which may help us derive diagram chasing theorems such as \(5\)-lemma and snake lemma. In an abelian category, all finite limits and colimits exist, in particular, pullbacks exist and they preserve monomorphisms and epimorphisms. </p><blockquote><p>Lemma 3.

First, we have \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\rightarrow Y\) is zero and \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\) is zero, so we have a factorization \(X\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow Y\) by the universal property of cokernels. It remains to show that \(\beta:\mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow Y\) is a monomorphism. Suppose \(\varphi_1,\varphi_2:Z\rightarrow \mathrm{Coim}(f)\) with \(\beta\circ \varphi_1=\beta\circ \varphi_2\), therefore \(\beta\circ \sigma=0\) where \(\sigma=\varphi_1-\varphi_2\). Consider the pullback \(W=X\times_{\mathrm{Coim}(f)}Z\) with \(\tau:W\rightarrow Z\) and \(\pi:W\rightarrow X\) of the maps \(\mathrm{Coim}(f)\) and \(\sigma\). We note that \(f\circ\pi=\beta\circ\mathrm{Coim}(f)\circ \pi=\beta\circ\sigma\circ\tau=0\), so \(\pi\) factors through \(\mathrm{Ker}(f)\) by \(W\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(f)\hookrightarrow X\) say \(w:W\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(f)\). Therefore, \(\sigma\circ\tau=\mathrm{Coim}(f)\circ \mathrm{Ker}(f)\circ w=0\circ w=0\). Since pullbacks preserve epimorphisms, \(\tau\) is epic.

We denote by \(\overline{f}:\mathrm{Coim}(f)\rightarrow \mathrm{Im}(f)\) the map induced by this factorization, and say \(f\) is <em>strict</em> if \(\overline{f}\) is an isomorphism. </p><!-- --><blockquote><p>Theorem 4.

Since \(\mathrm{Coim}(f)\hookrightarrow B\) is monic, it is the kernel of its cokernel, so it is the kernel of \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)\). Since \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\) in our construction is also the kernel of \(\mathrm{Coker}(f)\), the induced map \(\overline{f}\) is an isomorphism by the universal property of kernels.</p>    </div></div></blockquote><p>In an abelian category, suppose \(f:A\rightarrow B\) and \(g:B\rightarrow C\) are such that \(g\circ f=0\). We factor \(A\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\), and since \(A\twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\rightarrow C\) is zero and \(A\twoheadrightarrow\mathrm{Im}(f)\) is epic, we have \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\rightarrow C\) is zero. Thus, we can factor \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\hookrightarrow B\) as \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(g)\hookrightarrow B\), and the map \(\mathrm{Im}(f)\rightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(g)\) is the <em>canonical map</em>. We say such sequence \(A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\) is <em>exact</em> if the canonical map is an isomorphism. More generally, a sequence \(d_A^i:A^i\rightarrow A^{i+1}\)<br>\[\cdots\longrightarrow A^{i-1}\xrightarrow{\ d^{i-1}_A\ } A^i\xrightarrow{\ \ d^{i}_A\ \ }  A^{i+1}\longrightarrow\cdots\]is called a <em>(co)chain complex</em> if each three term subsequence compose to zero, and exact or acyclic if each three term subsequence is exact.

We write \(f^\bullet\simeq g^\bullet\) if they are <em>chain homotopic</em>, and we say \(A^\bullet\) and \(B^\bullet\) are <em>chain homotopy equivalent</em> if there are chain maps \(f^\bullet:A\rightarrow B\) and \(g^\bullet:B\rightarrow A\) s.t. \(f^\bullet\circ g^\bullet \simeq \mathbf{1}_{B^\bullet}\) and \(g^\bullet\circ f^\bullet \simeq \mathbf{1}_{A^\bullet}\), in which case \(f^\bullet\) are \(g^\bullet\) called <em>homotopy pseudo-inverses</em>. If \(A\) is a category, let \(C(\mathcal A)\) be the category of chain complexes in \(\mathcal A\) with chain maps are morphisms. If \(\mathcal A\) is additive, then \(C(\mathcal A)\) inherits an obvious group structure on its morphisms, and they make it an additive category as well. Also, if \(\mathcal A\) is abelian then so is \(C(\mathcal A)\). Let \(C^+(\mathcal A)\) be the full subcategory of \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded below (exists \(N\in\mathbb Z\) s.t. \(A^i=\mathbb 0\) for \(i &lt; N \)), and similarly \(C^-(\mathcal A)\) is the full subcategory \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded above. Let \(C^b(\mathcal A)\) be the full subcategory of \(C(\mathcal A)\) where the complexes are bounded below and above.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 5. Let \(A^\bullet\) be a cochain complex in \(\mathcal A\) with canonical morphisms \(\mathrm{Im}(d^{n-1})\rightarrow\mathrm{Ker}(d^{n})\), define<br>\[H^n(A^\bullet)=\mathrm{Coker}(\mathrm{Im}(d^{n-1})\rightarrow\mathrm{Ker}(d^{n}))\]as the \(n\)-th cohomology object. In fact, for a chain map \(f^\bullet: A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\), we associate an induced morphism \(H^nf^\bullet:H^n(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(B^\bullet)\), which makes \(H^n\) an additive functor \(C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow\mathcal A\). Moreover, \(f^\bullet\) is said to be a <em>quasi-isomorphism</em> if \(H^nf^\bullet\) is an isomorphism for all \(n\in\mathbb Z\).</p></blockquote><p>Let \(\mathcal A\) be an abelian category. The <em>translation functor</em> \(T:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C(\mathcal A)\) sends a complex \(A^\bullet =(A^i,d^i)\) to the complex \(T(A^\bullet) =(A^{i+1},-d^{i+1})\), and \(T(f^\bullet):T(A^\bullet)\rightarrow T(B^\bullet)\) for \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is given by \(T(f^\bullet)^i=f^{i+1}\). The functor essentially shifts the complex left by one, where the negative sign of the differential is a convention useful later. We denote by \(A^\bullet[n]=T^n(A^\bullet)\) for \(n\in\mathbb Z\) (negative integers correspond to right translations). The right truncation functor \(\tau_{\le n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C^-(\mathcal A)\) sends a complex in the following way <iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMTAsWzIsMCwiQV5uIl0sWzIsMSwiXFxtYXRocm17S2VyfShkXntufSkiXSxbMSwwLCJBXntuLTF9Il0sWzMsMCwiQV57bisxfSJdLFsxLDEsIkFee24tMX0iXSxbMywxLCJcXG1hdGhiZnswfSJdLFs0LDAsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbMCwwLCJcXGNkb3RzIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxjZG90cyJdLFs0LDEsIlxcY2RvdHMiXSxbMCwxLCIiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJ0YWlsIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJtYXBzIHRvIn19fV0sWzIsMF0sWzAsM10sWzQsMSwiIiwyLHsiY29sb3VyIjpbMCw2MCw2MF19XSxbMSw1XSxbMyw2XSxbNywyXSxbOCw0XSxbNSw5XV0=&embed" width="375" height="180" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe> where the red arrow is induced via universal property. The functor \(\tau_{\le n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow \mathcal A\) sends the morphisms in the obvious way. Moreover, we have a canonical monomorphism \(\tau_{\le n}(A^\bullet)\rightarrow A^\bullet\) which induces isomorphisms on their cohomology objects. The left truncation functor \(\tau_{\ge n}:C(\mathcal A)\rightarrow C^+(\mathcal A)\) is defined dually. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 6. Suppose \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is a morphism in \(C(\mathcal A)\) for some abelian category \(\mathcal A\). The <em>cone</em> of \(f^\bullet\) is \(\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)=A^\bullet[1]\oplus B^\bullet\). Spelled out explicitly, the cochain complex consists of objects \(A^{n+1}\oplus B^n\), and the differential \(d^n:A^{n+1}\oplus B^n\rightarrow A^{n+2}\oplus B^{n+1}\) is given by<br>\[d^n=\begin{pmatrix}-d_{A^\bullet}^{n+1}&amp;0\\ f^{n+1}&amp; d_{B^\bullet}^n\end{pmatrix}\]acting as though on column vectors.</p></blockquote><p>We remark that a short exact sequence of complexes induces a long exact sequence of cohomology. Say we have<br>\[\mathbf 0\longrightarrow A^{\bullet}\xrightarrow{\ f^{\bullet}\ } B^\bullet\xrightarrow{\ g^\bullet\ }  C^\bullet\longrightarrow\mathbf 0\]a short exact sequence of complexes, then for each \(n\), exists \(\delta^n:H^n(C^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(A^\bullet)\) making<br>\[\cdots\rightarrow H^n(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(B^\bullet)\rightarrow H^n(C^\bullet)\xrightarrow{\delta^n} H^{n+1}(A^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(B^\bullet)\rightarrow H^{n+1}(C^\bullet)\rightarrow\cdots\]exact. This is a very common construction in homological algebra, and the way we construct these connecting morphisms is by applying the snake lemma twice. Suppose \(f^\bullet:A^\bullet\rightarrow B^\bullet\) is a chain map with cone \(C^\bullet=\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\), then the map \(<br>\iota^{n}=0 \oplus \operatorname{Id}_{B^{n}}: B^{n} \rightarrow C^{n}<br>\) and the canonical projection \(\rho^n:C^n\rightarrow A^{n+1}\) gives chain maps \(\iota^\bullet:B^\bullet\rightarrow C^\bullet\) and \(\rho^\bullet:C^\bullet \rightarrow A^\bullet [1]\) which fits into a short exact sequence \[\mathbf 0\longrightarrow B^{\bullet}\xrightarrow{\ \iota^{\bullet}\ } C^\bullet\xrightarrow{\ \rho^\bullet\ }  A^\bullet[1]\longrightarrow\mathbf 0\]Hence this induces a long exact sequence on cohomology objects. Working out the connecting morphism, we find out that the connecting morphisms are nothing more than the induced morphisms \(\delta^n=H^{n+1}f^\bullet\). From this fact, we deduce that \(f^\bullet\) is a quasi-isomorphism iff the cone \(\mathrm{Cone}(f^\bullet)\) is acyclic. </p><blockquote><p>Definition 7. Suppose \(\mathcal A\) is an abelian category. An object \(X\) in \(\mathcal A\) is <em>injective</em> (resp. <em>projective</em>) if the contravariant (resp. covariant) left exact (resp. right exact) hom-functor \(\mathrm{Hom}(-,X):\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathbf{Ab}\) (resp. \(\mathrm{Hom}(X,-):\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathbf{Ab}\)) is exact. Moreover, we say \(\mathcal A\) has <em>enough injectives</em> (resp. <em>enough projectives</em>) if for any object \(Y\) there is an injective object (resp. projective object) \(X\) and a monomorphism \(Y\rightarrow X\) (resp. epimorphism \(X\rightarrow Y\)). An <em>injective resolution</em> of an object \(X\) is a complex \(I^\bullet\) bounded below \(0\) and a quasi-isomorphism \(X\rightarrow I^\bullet\), or equivalently, an exact sequence<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow X\rightarrow I^0\rightarrow I^1\rightarrow \cdots\]where each \(I^i\) is injective. Dually, a <em>projective resolution</em> of an object \(X\) is a complex \(P_\bullet\) bounded above \(0\) and a quasi-isomorphism \(P_\bullet\rightarrow X\), or equivalently, an exact sequence\[\cdots\rightarrow P_1\rightarrow P_0\rightarrow X\rightarrow \mathbf 0\]where each \(P_i\) is projective.</p></blockquote><p>It is a familiar result in homological algebra that if an abelian category has enough injectives (resp. enough projectives) then every object has an injective resolution (resp. projective resolution).

This implies that additive functors take split exact sequences to split exact sequences.<br>Suppose \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is a left exact functor betweeen abelian categories, then applying \(\mathscr{F}\) to a short exact sequence \(\mathbf 0\rightarrow A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\) gives a short exact sequence \(\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(C)\). A natural question to ask is whether we could continue this exact sequence to the right. It turns out that there is a canonical way of doing so, by defining the right derived functors \(R^i\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow \mathcal B\), we may continue the exact sequence<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(C)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(A)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(B)\rightarrow R^1\mathscr{F}(C)\rightarrow\cdots\]Note that \(\mathscr{F}\) is exact iff \(R^1\mathscr{F}=0\), so in a sense the right derived functors measures how far \(\mathscr{F}\) is from exact.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 8. Let \(\mathcal A,\mathcal B\) be abelian categories and \(\mathcal A\) has enough injectives. Suppose \(\mathscr{F}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\) is a left-exact functor. Let \(X\in\mathcal A\) and suppose \(I^\bullet\) is an injective resolution, then we obtain a complex<br>\[\mathbf 0\rightarrow \mathscr{F}(I^0)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(I^1)\rightarrow\mathscr{F}(I^2)\rightarrow\cdots\]Define the right derived functors as the additive functors \(R^i\mathscr{F};\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B\)<br>\[R^i\mathscr{F}(X)=H^i(\mathscr{F}I^\bullet)\]for \(i\ge 0\). Left derived functors \(L_i\mathscr{F}\) are defined dually via projective resolution.</p></blockquote><p>The most important examples of derived functors are the Ext and Tor functors. The Ext functor is the right derived functor of the hom-functor, and the Tor functor is the left derived functor of tensor product. Recall that there is a tensor-Hom adjunction \(\mathrm{Hom}(Y\otimes X,Z)\cong \mathrm{Hom}(Y,\mathrm{Hom}(X,Z))\), so these functors are related very closely.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 9. For \(A,B\in \mathbf{Mod}_R\), define the Ext functors\[\begin{aligned}\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(A,B)&amp;=(R^i\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,-))(B)\\ &amp;\cong (R^i\mathrm{Hom}_R(-,B))(A)\end{aligned} \] and the Tor functors \[\begin{aligned}\mathrm{Tor}_i^R(A,B)&amp;= (L_i(A\otimes_R -))(B)\\ &amp;\cong (L_i(-\otimes_R B))(A)\end{aligned}\] for all \(i\ge 0\).</p></blockquote><!--- --><blockquote><p>Example 10. Derived functors can help us defined many (co)homology theory.</p><ol><li><em>Sheaf cohomology.</em> Let \(X\) be a topological space, then the global section functor \(\Gamma:\mathrm{Sh}(X)\rightarrow \mathbf{Ab}\) which sends \(\mathscr{F} \mapsto \mathscr{F}(X)\) is left exact, its right derived functor \(H^i(X,-):\mathrm{Sh}(X)\rightarrow \mathbf{Ab}\) is the <em>sheaf cohomology</em> \(H^i(X,\mathscr{F})\). Its special cases include the de Rham cohomology. </li><li><em>Group cohomology.</em> Let \(k\) be an algebraically closed field and \(G\) a group, then the invariant functor \((-)^G:\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\rightarrow\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\), which is the same as \(\mathrm{Hom}_{k[G]}(k,-)\), is left exact, its right derived functor \(H^i(G;-):\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\rightarrow\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\) gives the group cohomology \(H^i(G;M)=\mathrm{Ext}^i_{k[G]}(k,M)\).</li><li><em>Hochschild cohomology.</em> This one I’m not really familiar, so I will not write about it in detail.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The derived functors are natural in the sense that if we have a morphism of two short exact sequence in \(\mathcal A\), then the induced morphisms of the long exact sequences in \(\mathcal B\) commutes with the long exact sequences. Finally, I’d like to finish with the definition of the homotopy category of complexes. We say that a chain map is <em>nullhomotopic</em> if it is homotopic to the zero chain.</p><blockquote><p>Definition 11. Let \(\mathcal A\) be an abelian category, the <em>homotopy category of complexes</em> \( K(\mathcal A)\) is the category where objects are (co)chain complexes in \(\mathcal A\) and morphisms are chain maps up to homotopy, i.e. \[\mathrm{Hom}_{K(\mathcal A)}(A^\bullet,B^\bullet)=\mathrm{Hom}_{C(\mathcal A)}(A^\bullet,B^\bullet)/G\] where \(G\) is the subgroup of nullhomotopic chain maps.</p></blockquote><p>There are many things that needs to be checked here for it to be well defined, which we omit.

&lt;p&gt;I have always been curious about derived categories.

Also, I’ve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don’t understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\).&lt;/p&gt;

Because they were talking about blowing up six points on the plane.”</p><p style="text-align: right;"> Anonymous </p></blockquote><p>I spent my last week in Quebec attending the <a href="https://cumc.math.ca/2022/presentation-database">Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2022</a>. It was really an intense week of learning. I learned a lot and met many smart and interesting people. So I wanted to write about the things I learned and the people I met during the conference. There were so many excellent talks but unfortunately I could only attend some of them. In particular, there are some very good ones in geometry, topology, representation theory, algebra, logic theory, etc.<br><span id="more"></span></p><ol><li><em>When Polynomials don’t Commute: An Introduction to Ore Extensions</em> by Nick Priebe. Non-commutative algebra is a central topic in modern algebra research, which concerns objects such as non-commutative rings. Suppose \(R\) is a ring, \(\sigma:R\rightarrow R\) a homomorphism, \(\delta:R\rightarrow R\) a \(\sigma\)-derivation i.e. a homomorphism s.t. \(\delta(rs)=\sigma(r)\delta(s)+\delta(r)s\), then an <em>Ore extension</em> or a <em>skew polynomial ring</em> is the noncommutative ring \(R[x;\sigma,\delta]\) where the multiplication satisfies \(xr=\sigma(r)x+\delta(r)\). Nick provided some examples of noncommutative rings that are useful in physics. He also introduced some basic results and open problems about their representations. I am actually quite curious about the relationship between noncommutative algebra and noncommutative geometry.</li><li><em>A Brief Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory</em> by Jacob Ender. Homotopy type theory is a new foundation of mathematics which is developed from intuitionist type theory. In HoTT, the fundamental objects are types, and we can build dependent types with \(\sum_{(x:A)}B(x)\) (analogue of \(\exists x\in A,B(x)\)) and \(\prod_{(x:A)}B(x)\) (analogue of \(\forall x\in A,B(x)\)). To avoid Russell’s paradox, we can build a tower of universes. Jacob also introduced Voevodsky’s Univalence axiom \((A= B)\simeq (A\simeq B)\) so isomorphic objects are equal. HoTT is very analogous to homotopy theory in the sense of its \(\infty\)-groupoid structure. Currently there is a lot of research in their higher-categorical models and their application in computer proof assistants.</li><li><em>Waring Squaring</em> by Maya Gusak. A classical result in number theory is that each natural number is the sum of at most four squares. Waring’s problem asks for which \(k\in\mathbb N\) exists \(s\in\mathbb Z^+\) s.t. each \(n\in\mathbb N\) can be written as a sum \(n=n_1^k+n_2^k+\cdots+n_s^k\), where \(n_1,\dots,n_s\in\mathbb N\). To tackle this problem, mathematicians used so called circle method. Additionally, this method can be used to prove Vinogradov’s theorem (every odd natural number \(n&gt;5\) is the sum of three primes), but fails to solve Goldbach conjecture.</li><li><em>ADE Classification for Quivers of Finite Representation Type</em> by Xinrui You. A quiver is a multidigraph (i.e. a directed graph with multiple edges and loops allowed) which simulates underlying structure of a category. A representation of a quiver sends each vertex to a vector space or a module and each edge to a morphism. These representations decompose just as representations of finite groups. One fundamental result in the classification of quivers is Gabriel’s theorem. Gabriel’s theorem says that a quiver of finite representation type is a union of Dynkin graphs of type A, D, or E. </li><li><em>The Nash Embedding Theorem for Tori in \(3\)-space</em> by Diba Heydary. A fundamental result in Riemannian geometry is that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically (preserving the length of every path) embedded into a Euclidean space. Diba talked about a specific example of an embedding of a torus in the Euclidean \(3\)-space. A torus has a polygonal representation which can be used to create this embedding. Whitney embedding theorem is a similar result for differentiable manifolds.</li><li><em>Dissection of Polyhedra and the Dehn invariant</em> by James Bona-Landry. The Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem says that that two polygons can be dissected and transformed to each other iff they have the same area. The natural generalization of this question into \(3\) dimensions does not hold. This is due to the Dehn invariant \(\sum_i\ell_i\otimes \theta_i\in \mathbb R\otimes (\mathbb R/2\pi \mathbb Z)\). We can show that there are polyhedra that share same volume but has different Dehn invariant, which means they can not transform to each other via dissection. In fact the Dehn-Sydler theorem says that they can transform to each other via dissection iff they have the same volume and same Dehn invariant. The generalization for higher dimensions is still open.</li><li><em>An Introduction to Linear Logic</em> by Amélie Comtois. Linear logic is different from classical logic in that if \(A\rightarrow B\) is used then \(A\) is no longer available anymore. She also talked about sequent calculus, which is a formal calculus of logic. Linear logic uses drastically different logical symbols than classical logic as well. Linear logic is an extension of classical logic, and classical logic can be realized in linear logic. Linear logic is thought of as the language of quantum theory. Moreover, I discussed with Amélie about category theory, and I learned from her about multicategories and higher categories. </li><li><em>Exploring Quivers, Representations, and Varieties via Multisegments</em> by Iretomiwa Ajala. This is another talk about quivers, and much more technical than that of Xinrui. Iretomiwa introduced multisegments, and discussed how they related to quivers of type A. He also mentions parabolic induction, which is a method of obtaining a representation of a reductive group from the representations of its parabolic subgroups. </li><li><em>An Introduction to Coxeter Groups and the Properties of their Weak Order</em> by Kimia Shaban. A very interesting talk on the combinatorial side of Coxeter groups. Coxeter groups are a type of groups generated by reflections. She discussed their classification, and the Sperner property of the weak order on Coxeter groups. In the end, she also talked about a conjecture she and her supervisor wish to disprove about the Sperner property of the weak order. </li><li><em>Univariate Tropical Polynomials</em> by Charlotte Lavoie-Bel. Tropical polynomical replace addition with the minimum function and multiplication by the usual addition, which makes it a semifield. Tropical polynomials can be graphed and they will have a cell-looking structure. They can be thought of as the limit of logarithm under base \(0\). They also have a different notion of roots than regular polynomials. We can consider zero locus of tropical polynomials i.e. tropical varieties. The tropical version of some classical algebraic geometry theorems such as Riemann—Roch theorem, can be proven by combinatorial arguments. I like her quote that “tropical geometry is the combinatorial shadow of classical algebraic geometry”.</li></ol><p>There are many other excellent talks that I unfortunately did not attend, and I only wrote about some of the talks I went to. I also gave my own talk on Schubert calculus and cohomology of Grassmannians as the last student speaker of the conference, which you can view in a <a href="/archives/a5b2dbed/">previous post</a>.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;I spent my last week in Quebec attending the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cumc.math.ca/2022/presentation-database&quot;&gt;Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2022&lt;/a&gt;. It was really an intense week of learning. I learned a lot and met many smart and interesting people. So I wanted to write about the things I learned and the people I met during the conference. There were so many excellent talks but unfortunately I could only attend some of them. In particular, there are some very good ones in geometry, topology, representation theory, algebra, logic theory, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the end, I didn’t feel I understood Chern classes so I only briefly mentioned how it could be used for proving that there are \(27\) lines on a smooth cubic surface. Origianlly, I had hoped to also learn about generalized flag varieties, Bruhat decomposition, and Borel–Weil–Bott theorem, but I really ran out of stamina. Perhaps I will find sometime to learn about them in the future.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/spoiler.css" type="text/css"><script src="/js/spoiler.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>]]></content>
