    <title>Project Sigma: My Journey with Mathematics</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Project Sigma is a collection of my personal course notes on various mathematical topics, mostly related to geometry and number theory, and a collection of exercises I have done on these subjects. I decided to start this project primarily as a motivation for myself to learn and as a way of recording my learning progress. That being said, it would also make me very happy if someone else benefits from my work. Each of the subject will have their own GitHub repository, typically named as “Project-Sigma-XXX” where XXX is an abbriviation of the subject. They will probably contain a lot of typos and errors, and if you found one, you are welcomed to open an issue page on the respective repository and point out my mistake. </p><span id="more"></span><p>Currently, the following subjects are planned.<br><table>  <tr>    <th>Subject</th>    <th>Repository</th>    <th>Status</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Algebraic Geometry</td>    <td><a href="https://github.com/YunhaiXiang/Project-Sigma-ALG">Project-Sigma-ALG</a></td>    <td>Incomplete</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Arithmetic Geometry</td>    <td><a href="https://github.com/YunhaiXiang/Project-Sigma-ARG">Project-Sigma-ARG</a></td>    <td>Incomplete</td>  </tr></table></p><p>I also plan to add new subjects in the future, but only after the current ones are completed over 75%. To download the material, simply go to the corresponding repository and either download the newest release or just clone the repository directly. When writing these notes, I will try to adhere to the following philosophies:</p><ul><li>Consistent and unambiguous notation: this means that I will follow the same notation conventions for all of the course notes and exercises. I will also clearly state any abuse of notation I will use.</li><li>Sketches of proof: this means that I will provide bullet points of my reasoning for many of the exercises and theorems instead of providing full proofs. I will try to make them as perspicuous and coherent as I can.</li><li>Prototypical examples: this means that I will give quintessential examples and non-examples for important notions. Examples help myself to build intuitions for abstract concepts.</li></ul><p>Finally, note that this project is licensed under <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Common BY-NC 4.0</a>, which means that you are free to share or adapt these documents for non-commercial purposes if you give appropriate credit.
