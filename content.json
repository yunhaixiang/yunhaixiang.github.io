My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yee-o-en-hi si-ang”), and I also go by Daniel. I’m an undergraduate pure math student at University of Waterloo in Canada. I can be reached via email. I started this math blog when I was a third year undergraduate student as a motivation for myself to learn and as a way of recording my learning progress. Here, I usually write about mathematics that I find interesting, and share my own expositions and notes on a diverse set of mathematical topics. Moreover, I have some personal projects which you should definitely check out! Besides math, I also occasionally write about my personal life, my random thoughts and ideas, and many topics outside math I enjoy. My mathematical interest mainly lies in algebraic geometry and especially in topics related to mirror symmetry and theoretical physics, but I am also very interested in arithmetic geometry, symplectic geometry, category theory, homotopy theory, representation theory, and algebraic combinatorics. Outside of math, I’m extremely curious about a wide range of topics, including theoretical physics (especially special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, TQFTs, and string theory), computer science (especially algorithms, quantum computation, homotopy type theory, and computer graphics), music (especially singing, piano &amp; guitar playing, composing, and music theory), and magic (especially close-up magic and mentalism). In my free time, I enjoy video games (big fan of FromSoftware games like Elden Ring, Sekiro, Bloodborne and the Dark Souls franchise, the God of War and Uncharted games are also among my favorites), music (especially pop and classical music, and sometimes rock music as well), anime (some of my favorites include One Punch Man, Gintama, Megalo Box, Parasyte, Asobi Asobase, Tanaka kun is always listless, Great Pretender, Hyouka, and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood), and abstract strategy board games (always wanted to get good at the game of Go).

Bloch In this week we discuss fppf sites (recall that we defined \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\) in last week) and faithfully flat descent. This will help us to build our way to the definition of a stack. The idea of faifully flat descent is that a certain property of schemes can be descended via a cartesian square with a fppf side. The important result we are building towards is that for any scheme \\(X\\), the functor of points \\(\\mathscr{H}_X\\) is a sheaf on the fppf site of \\(X\\). After this, we can talk about fibred categories. Fibred categories plus descents is categorical stacks, plus geometry is algebraic stacks. Fppf site and faithfully flat descentWe recall that a map of schemes is fppf iff it is faithfully flat (i.e. flat and surjective) and locally of finite presentation, and recall that the fppf site \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\) consists of the fppf covers, i.e. the jointly surjective, flat and locally of finite presentation families of morphisms. We have the following problem. Theorem 1. Suppose \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\) is a morphism of schemes, the functor of points \\(\\mathscr{H}_X\\) is a sheaf on \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/Y)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\). Proof Proof is very long, see Theorem 4.1.2 in Olsson’s book. This theorem has a very long proof and the reason it is important is delayed to later. Another important result is faithfully flat descent. The idea is, if \\(P\\) is some property of morphism of schemes, given morphisms of schemes \\(f_1:X_1\\rightarrow Y_1\\) and \\(f_2:X_2\\rightarrow Y_2\\) and suppose there is a commutative diagram then frequently \\(f_1\\) has property \\(P\\) iff \\(f_2\\) does. We say that \\(P\\) is local on the base (target) for the fppf topology (et al. Zariski, etc.) if \\(f_1\\) has property \\(P\\) implies \\(f_2\\) does. Examples of properties that are local on the base for the fppf topology inlcude: surjective, locally of finite type, locally of finite presentation, universally closed/open, separated, proper, etc. The full proof can be found on stacks project. Fibred categoriesFor a category \\(\\mathcal C\\), a category over \\(\\mathcal C\\) is some category \\(\\mathcal F\\) equipped with a functor \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal C\\). We draw diagrams with the notation \\(\\xi\\mapsto U\\) to mean \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)=U\\), and a diagram of the form commutes iff \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi=f\\). Moreover, we say that a morphism \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) in \\(\\mathcal F\\) is cartesian if for all \\(\\zeta\\in\\mathcal F\\) and morphisms \\(\\psi:\\zeta \\rightarrow \\eta\\) and \\(h:\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\zeta)\\rightarrow \\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)\\) such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi \\circ h=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\psi\\), there exists unique \\(\\theta:\\zeta\\rightarrow\\xi\\) such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\theta=h\\) and \\(\\psi=\\phi\\circ\\theta\\), as indicated in the diagram and when \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) is cartesian, we say that \\(\\xi\\) is a pullback of \\(\\eta\\) (to \\(U\\) along \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi\\)). This diagram is sometimes known as the “universal property” of cartesian morphisms. Note that given two pullbacks \\(\\phi_1:\\xi_1\\rightarrow\\eta\\) and \\(\\phi_2:\\xi_2\\rightarrow\\eta\\) then substitute \\(\\psi=\\xi_i\\) for \\(i=1,2\\) will give us an isomorphism \\(\\xi_1\\cong\\xi_2\\). Thus, pullbacks are unique up to a unique isomorphism. Note that in SGA1 the definition of cartesian arrow is different and this definition is sometimes known as strongly cartesian. Next, we introduce the following properties, which is easy to check, Proposition 2. Let \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal C\\) be a category over the category \\(\\mathcal C\\). composite of cartesian arrows are cartesian, if \\(\\psi:\\eta\\rightarrow \\zeta\\) and \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) are arrows in \\(\\mathcal F\\) with \\(\\psi\\) cartesian, then \\(\\phi\\) is cartesian iff \\(\\psi\\circ\\phi\\) is, if \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) is an arrow and \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi\\) is an isomorphism, then \\(\\phi\\) is cartesian iff it is an isomorphism, With these knowledge, we can introduce fibred categories. Fibred categories are used to provide a general framework for descent theory. They formalize various situations in geometry and algebra where pullbacks of objects are defined. A motivating example is the category of vector bundles on a topological space. Definition 3. A fibred category over a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a category \\(\\mathcal F\\) over \\(\\mathcal C\\) such that for each \\(f:U\\rightarrow V\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) where \\(V=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\eta)\\) for some \\(\\eta\\in \\mathcal F\\), there exists \\(\\xi\\in\\mathcal F\\) with \\(U=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)\\) and cartesian arrow \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) such that \\(f=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi\\). Suppose \\(\\mathcal F,\\mathcal G\\) are fibred categories over \\(\\mathcal C\\), then a morphism of fibred categories \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow \\mathcal G\\) is a functor such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal G}\\circ \\mathscr{F}=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\) and \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) sends cartesian arrows to cartesian arrows. Suppose \\(\\mathcal F\\) is a category over \\(\\mathcal C\\) and \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\), write \\(\\mathcal F(U)\\) as the subcategory of \\(\\mathcal F\\) whose objects are \\(\\xi\\in\\mathcal F\\) such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)=U\\) and morphisms are \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow \\eta\\) where \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi=\\mathbf{1}_U\\). If \\(\\mathscr{F},\\mathscr{G}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow \\mathcal G\\) are morphisms of fibred categories, a base-preserving natural transformation \\(\\alpha:\\mathscr{F}\\rightarrow \\mathscr{G}\\) is a natural transformation such that for all \\(u\\in\\mathcal F\\) we have \\(\\alpha(u):\\mathscr{F}(u)\\rightarrow \\mathscr{G}(u)\\) is such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{F}(u))=\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{G}(u))\\) and \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal G}\\alpha(u)=\\mathbf 1_{\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{F}(u))}\\), i.e. \\(\\alpha(u)\\) is a morphism in \\(\\mathcal G(\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{F}(u)))\\). Denote by \\(\\mathrm{MOR}_{\\mathcal C}(\\mathcal F,\\mathcal G)\\) the category whose objects are morphisms of fibred categories and morphisms are base-preserving natural transformations. For a morphism of fibred categories \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal G\\) over \\(\\mathcal C\\) and \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\), we write \\(\\mathscr{F}_U:\\mathcal F(U)\\rightarrow \\mathcal G(U)\\) to denote the functor where \\(\\mathscr{F}_U(\\xi)=\\mathscr{F}(\\xi)\\) and \\(\\mathscr{F}_U\\phi=\\mathscr{F}\\phi\\). Thus in a fibred category we can pullback objects along any arrow. For example, for a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(X\\in\\mathcal C\\), we have \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is fibred over \\(\\mathcal C\\) via \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal C/X}:\\mathcal C/X\\rightarrow \\mathcal C\\) given by \\((Y\\rightarrow X)\\mapsto Y\\) and morphisms are mapped to themsleves. It should be easy to check that this is well-defined. Why do we need fibred categories? Suppose \\(f:X\\rightarrow Y\\) is a morphism of schemes. For any morphism of schemes \\(t:T\\rightarrow Y\\) we can form a fibred product \\(T\\times_Y X\\) which is only unique up to a unique isomorphism. Thus implicitly there is a choice being made. This becomes a technical obstacle in developing the theory of stacks, and fibred categories are used to address this problem. For more detail, see Example 3.1.5 in Olsson’s book. The collection of categories fibred over a fixed category is an example of a \\(2\\)-category. Roughly speaking, a \\(2\\)-category is a category where the morphisms between two objects form a category. However, we will not use higher categorical language. Lemma 4. Let \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal G\\) be a morphism of fibred categories over \\(\\mathcal C\\), \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) is fully faithful (as a functor) iff \\(\\mathscr{F}_U:\\mathcal F(U)\\rightarrow \\mathcal G(U)\\) is fully faithful for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\), \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) is an equivalence (of categories) iff \\(\\mathscr{F}_U:\\mathcal F(U)\\rightarrow \\mathcal G(U)\\) is an equivalence for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\). Proof Lemma 3.1.8, Olsson. Recall the classical Yoneda lemma: for each object \\(A\\in\\mathcal C\\) we have a natural isomorphism between the collection of natural transformations \\(\\mathrm{Nat}(\\mathscr{F},\\mathscr{H}^A)\\), and the set \\(\\mathscr{F}(A)\\). This point of view is crucial for the development of algebraic spaces, and also for fibred categories we need a variant of this lemma. Theorem 5 (\\(2\\)-Yoneda lemma). Suppose \\(\\mathcal F\\) is fibred over \\(\\mathcal C\\), there is an equivalence\\[\\mathrm{MOR}_{\\mathcal C}(\\mathcal C/X,\\mathcal F)\\cong \\mathcal F(X)\\]given by \\(\\mathscr{F}\\mapsto \\mathscr{F}(\\mathbf 1_{X})\\). Proof Proposition 3.2.2 Olsson. It is often useful to think of a fibred category as the collection of categories \\(\\mathcal{F}(U)\\) with a pullback functor. Thus, we introduce split fibred categories. We will not go over the details of the rigorous definition, but the reader can check 3.3.1 in Olsson’s book.","link":"/archives/9693c172/"},{"title":"Week 1: Galois cohomology and Mordell—Weil theorem","text":"“In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.” George Cantor This week I finally finished my final project for my PMATH 499 reading course in arithmetic geometry. My project is called “Galois cohomology and weak Mordell—Weil theorem”, which is available here. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \\(k\\) with an algebraic closure \\(K\\), the Galois group \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit of topological Galois groups \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \\(L/k\\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \\(G\\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \\(G\\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \\(G\\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation. My final project focuses on the proof of the weak Mordell—Weil theorem, which states that for any elliptic curve \\(E\\), the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is finite for all \\(n\\ge 2\\). This is an important step in the proof of the Mordell—Weil theorem which states the elliptic curve groups are finitely generated. The proof of Mordell—Weil involves in applying an infinite descent argument to weak Mordell—Weil, which I will not go into detail. The motivating observation is that we have an exact sequence of topological \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\)-modules \\[\\mathbf{0}\\rightarrow E(K)[n]\\rightarrow E(K)\\xrightarrow{n}E(K)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{0}\\]This short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which we truncate after the first cohomology groups. The first cohomology group can be viewed as the group of crossed homomorphisms module the principal crossed homomorphisms, where a crossed homomorphism is some \\(f\\) with \\(f(gh)=gf(h)+f(g)\\) for all \\(g,h\\) and a principal crossed homomorphism is a homomorphism where there exists \\(m\\) with \\(f(g)=gm-m\\) for all \\(g\\). This can be verified by just computing out the differential. Next, we define the \\(n\\)-Selmer groups and the Tate-Shafarevich group, which is applied to the induced exact sequence we just found in order to obtain a better bound for the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\). Finally, the finiteness of \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is obtained from the finiteness of the Selmer groups.","link":"/archives/7dbb66b9/"},{"title":"Week 2: Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi","text":"“Complex analysis is the good twin and real analysis the evil one: beautiful formulas and elegant theorems seem to blossom spontaneously in the complex domain, while toil and pathology rule the reals.” Charles Pugh This week I plan to start writing about what I’ve learned in PMATH 965 on algebraic stacks. In the end of this semaster hopefully I will have written enough about them in this blog so that I can compile them into actual typesetted notes. We start by revisiting étale morphisms and introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Then, we will define important sites such as the big and small Zariski sites and étale sites as well as the fppf site. Étale morphisms of schemesFirst, we revisit the definitions and properties of étale morphisms of schemes. Definition 3. A morphism of schemes \\(f:X\\rightarrow Y\\) is étale if one of these equivalent conditions holds \\(f\\) is smooth and locally quasi-finite, \\(f\\) is smooth and unramified, \\(f\\) is flat and unramified, \\(f\\) is locally of finite presentation and formally étale \\(f\\) is locally of finite presentation and locally a standard étale morphism, There are many more equivalent definitions of étale morphisms listed on wikipedia. Intuitively, I think of étale morphisms analogous to covering maps. We need this notion to define the étale topology which we will need to use later. As a side note, there is also something called the étale fundamental group, which also uses the notion of étale morphisms. We recall these properties of étale morphisms. Proposition 4. compotision of étale maps are étale, if \\(f:Y\\rightarrow X\\) is étale then its base change \\(Y\\times_XZ\\rightarrow Z\\) is étale, if \\(f:Y\\rightarrow X\\) and \\(g:Z\\rightarrow X\\) are étale and \\(g=f\\circ h\\) where \\(h:Z\\rightarrow Y\\), then \\(h\\) is étale given algebraically closed field \\(k\\) and \\(k\\)-algebra \\(A\\), then the morphism \\(\\mathrm{Spec}(A)\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Spec}(k)\\) is étale iff it is the disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of \\(k\\). Now, we are ready to define Grothendieck topology and sites. Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoiRecall that a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space \\(X\\) is a contravariant functor \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}\\), and a presheaf is a sheaf when \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow\\prod_{i}\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\rightrightarrows\\prod_{i,j}\\mathscr{F}(U_i\\cap U_j)\\) is an equalizer for every open cover \\(\\{U_{i}\\}\\) of any open \\(U\\subseteq X\\), which is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms. We want to extend this from \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) to any category \\(\\mathcal C\\). To do this, we need to add some additional structure on the category \\(\\mathcal C\\) so that its objects can be viewed as “open sets” and morphisms can be viewed as “inclusions”. Grothendieck’s insight is that we don’t need the full strength of a topology to define sheaves, we only need intersections and a notion of when a collection of an open set forms an open cover of it. Definition 1. A Grothendieck topology on a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is the data of a set of coverings of \\(U\\), written as \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), for each object \\(U\\in \\mathcal C\\), where each covering \\(S\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) is a set of morphisms of \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(U\\) as targets, such that for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) for each isomorphism \\(\\varphi:V\\rightarrow U\\), we have \\(\\{\\varphi\\}\\in \\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) if \\(\\{V_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) and \\(\\{W_{i,j}\\rightarrow V_i\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(V_i)\\) for each \\(i\\), then \\(\\{W_{i,j}\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) for \\(\\{V_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) and \\(W\\rightarrow U\\), all \\(W\\times_UV_i\\) exists and \\(\\{W\\times_UV_i\\rightarrow W\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(W)\\) A category \\(\\mathcal C\\) equipped with a choice of Grothendieck topology, also denoted \\(\\mathcal C\\), is a site. A continuous functor between sites \\(f:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal D\\) is a functor between their underlying categories such that for all \\(\\{X_i\\rightarrow X\\}\\in \\mathrm{Cov}_{\\mathcal C}(X)\\) we have \\(\\{f(X_i)\\rightarrow f(X)\\}\\in \\mathrm{Cov}_{\\mathcal D}(f(X))\\), and it commutes with finite fibred products if they exist. For example, \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) for a topological space \\(X\\) can be made into a site using the usual notion of covering. We note that in \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) we have the fibered product \\(U\\times_X V=U\\cap V\\) for all open \\(U,V\\subseteq X\\), which agrees with the usual notion of intersection. For a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(X\\in\\mathcal C\\), the category of objects over \\(X\\), denoted \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is the category where objects are morphisms \\(Y\\rightarrow X\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) and morphisms between \\(Y_1\\rightarrow X\\) and \\(Y_2\\rightarrow X\\) are all morphisms \\(Y_1\\rightarrow Y_2\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) such that the obvious triangle commutes, i.e. \\((Y_1\\rightarrow Y_2\\rightarrow X)=Y_1\\rightarrow X\\). If \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a site, then \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) can be given a site structure, by letting \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U\\rightarrow X)\\) in \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) be \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\). The site \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is called the localization of the site \\(\\mathcal C\\) at \\(X\\). Suppose \\(X\\) is a scheme, then we say that the big Zariski (resp. big étale, resp. fppf) site, denoted \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{Zar}}\\) (resp. \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{ét}}\\), resp. \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\)) of \\(X\\), is the site with the category \\(\\mathbf{Sch}/X\\) and \\(\\{Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) iff each \\(Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) is an open immersion with \\(Y=\\bigcup_i Y_i\\) (resp. each \\(Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) is étale with \\(\\coprod_i Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) surjective, resp. each \\(Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) is flat and locally of finite presentation with \\(\\coprod_i Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) surjective). An element of \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U\\rightarrow X)\\) is called a Zariski cover (resp. étale cover, resp. fppf cover) of \\(U\\). The small Zariski site (resp. small étale site) of \\(X\\), denoted \\(X_{\\mathrm{Zar}}\\) (resp. \\(X_{\\mathrm{ét}}\\)) is the site whose category is the full subcategory of \\(\\mathrm{Sch}/X\\) where each object \\(U\\rightarrow X\\) is an open immersion (resp. étale), and the coverings are the same as the big Zariski (resp. big étale) site. The small Zariski site of \\(X\\) is equivalent to the site \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\). Moreover, we have the following inclusions\\[\\{\\mathrm{Zariski\\ cover}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{étale\\ cover}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{fppf\\ cover}\\}\\]Next, we discuss presheaves and sheaves on a site. This whole business is to get new cohomology theories such as étale cohomology, because basic sheaf cohomology is insufficient for our needs. Definition 2. A presheaf (of sets) on a site \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a contravariant functor \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}\\), and a presheaf is a sheaf iff \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow\\prod_{i}\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\rightrightarrows\\prod_{i,j}\\mathscr{F}(U_i\\times_U U_j)\\) is an equalizer for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\). A presheaf is called separated if for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), the map \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow \\prod_i\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\) is injective. We write \\(\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) (resp. \\(\\mathrm{PSh}(\\mathcal C)\\)) for the category of sheaves (resp. presheaves) of the site \\(\\mathcal C\\). Note that a separated presheaf can be viewed as a presheaf that only satisfies one of the axioms of a sheaf, the identity axiom, but not necessaily the gluability axiom, therefore we have the obvious inclusions\\[\\{\\mathrm{sheaves}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{separated\\ presheaves}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{presheaves}\\}\\]all of which admits left adjoints, the composition of them being sheafification. Usually, we can formulate sheafification in terms of compatible germs, but since we are working over sites, it does not make sense to take a point in an object and take the product of stalks. The way we construct the adjoint from presheaves to separated presheaves is to map a presheaf \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) to \\(\\mathscr{F}^{\\mathrm s}(U)=\\mathscr{F}(U)/\\sim\\) where \\(a\\sim b\\) iff exists \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) such that \\(a,b\\) are mapped to the same element by the map \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow \\prod_i\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\). We can check that this is in fact a separated presheaf. All of the above works for (pre)sheaves of rings, abelian groups, etc. Definition 3. A topos is a category equivalent to \\(\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) for a site \\(\\mathcal C\\). A morphism of topoi \\(f:\\mathcal{T}_1\\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_2\\) is an adjoint pair \\(f^*\\dashv f_*\\) of functors \\(f^*:\\mathcal{T}_1\\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_2\\) and \\(f_*:\\mathcal{T}_2\\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_1\\) with a choice of natural isomorphism\\[\\Phi:\\mathrm{Mor}_{\\mathcal T_1}(f^*(-),-)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Mor}_{\\mathcal T_2}(-,f_*(-))\\]where each naturality here means \\(\\Phi\\) is natural in each of the two dashes, and \\(f^*\\) commutes with finite limits when they exist. Define composition in the obvious way. We remark that in the above definition, commuting with finite limits is equivalent to checking that \\(f^*\\) commutes with finite products and preserve equalizers. In many cases, though not always, a continuous functor between sites \\(f:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow \\mathcal D\\) induces a functor \\(f_*:\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal D)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) by \\(f_*(\\mathscr{F})(X)=\\mathscr{F}(f(X))\\), where the well-definedness follows from \\(\\mathscr{F}(f(U_i\\times_U U_j))=\\mathscr{F}(f(U_i)\\times_{f(U)} f(U_j))\\) for any \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), as illustrated by the diagram This induced functor does not always admit a left adjoint. However, we have the following theorem Proposition 4. If \\(\\mathcal C,\\mathcal D\\) are sites with small underlying categories, then the functor \\(f_*:\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal D)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) induced by a continuous functor \\(f:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow \\mathcal D\\) admits a left adjoint \\(f^*:\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal D)\\). If, further, that finite limits in \\(\\mathcal C\\) are representable and \\(f\\) commutes with them, then \\(f^*\\) commutes with finite limits. Proof We construct this functor concretely. For each \\(U\\in\\mathcal D\\), let \\(\\mathcal I_U\\) be the category where objects are pairs \\(\\langle V,\\rho\\rangle\\) where \\(V\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\rho\\in \\mathrm{Mor}_\\mathcal{D}(U,f(V))\\), and a morphism \\(g:\\langle V_1,\\rho_1\\rangle \\rightarrow \\langle V_2,\\rho_2\\rangle\\) is a morphism \\(g:V_1\\rightarrow V_2\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) such that \\((fg)\\circ\\rho_1=\\rho_2\\). We define\\[f^*(\\mathscr{F})(U)=\\lim_{\\stackrel{\\longrightarrow}{\\langle V,\\rho\\rangle\\in\\mathcal I_{U}^\\mathrm{op}}}\\mathscr{F}(V)\\]and for each \\(h:U_1\\rightarrow U_2\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\), there is functor \\(\\mathcal I_{U_2}\\rightarrow \\mathcal I_{U_1}\\) given by \\(\\langle V,\\rho\\rangle\\mapsto \\langle V,\\rho\\circ h\\rangle\\) which induces a morphism \\(f^*(\\mathscr{F})(U_2)\\rightarrow f^*(\\mathscr{F})(U_1)\\). We can check that this is well-defined.","link":"/archives/46fca3c5/"},{"title":"Galois categories and Étale fundamental groups","text":"I’m in a good mood today because it’s my birthday 🎉 and I finally finished recording my final presentation for PMATH 965!

Sylvester This week is the first week of the spring term and also my first week of undergraduate research with Prof. Satriano, so I decided to write about a research paper I’ve given to read, this one. In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \\(\\sigma\\in S_n\\) acts on \\(v\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) by permutation, and let \\(\\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\\{\\sigma\\in S_n: w\\cdot \\sigma v=0\\}\\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \\(\\sum_ix_i=0\\), where \\(n\\ge 3\\). In notations, we have the following theorem. Theorem 1. For \\(n\\ge 3\\), we have\\[\\max\\{|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|: v\\in S,w\\in\\mathbf{R}^n\\}=2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor (n-2)!\\]where \\(S=\\{v\\in \\mathbf R^n: v\\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\ne 0, v\\mathrm{\\ has\\ distinct\\ coordinates}\\}\\). An explicit construction that achieves this bound is given by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, so it suffice to show that this is the best bound. The proof uses Bruhat order and Sperner property. Bruhat orderSuppose \\(\\alpha\\vdash n\\) with \\(\\ell(\\alpha)=m\\), and \\(i_j=\\sum_{k=1}^j\\alpha_j\\) for \\(j=0,1\\dots,m\\). Let \\(X_{\\alpha}\\) be the set of ordered set partitions of type \\(\\alpha\\). Naturally, we have \\(\\alpha^*\\in X_{\\alpha}\\) where \\(\\alpha^*_j=\\{i_j+1,i_j+2,\\dots,i_{j+1}\\}\\). Let \\(S(\\alpha)=\\{i_1,\\dots,i_{m-1}\\}\\). We have \\(S_n\\) acts on \\(X_{\\alpha}\\) by element, which is a transitive action. Thus identify \\(X_{\\alpha}\\cong S_n/S_\\alpha\\) where \\(S_{\\alpha}\\) is the stabilizer of \\(\\alpha^*\\). Denote \\(\\alpha!=|S_{\\alpha}|=\\prod_{i}\\alpha_i!\\) Definition 2. The Bruhat order on \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\) is the transitive closure (they are connected by relations of the following kind) of \\(B&lt;(i\\ j)B\\) for \\(B\\in S_n/S_\\alpha\\) where \\(i\\in B_a\\) and \\(j\\in B_b\\) and \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(i&lt;j\\). We note that the Bruhat order on \\(S_n/S_{(1,\\dots,1)}\\) is just the usual Bruhat order on \\(S_n\\). For \\(B\\in S_n/S_\\alpha\\) let \\(\\operatorname{word}(B)\\) be the permutation by concatonating the numbers in each set written in their usual order. This sends ordered set partitions to a more common definition: \\(\\sigma\\in S_n\\) where \\(\\sigma(i)&gt;\\sigma(i+1)\\) implies \\(i\\in S(\\alpha)\\), and Bruhat order restricted to such permutations. There is an obvious bijection \\((S_n/S_\\alpha)\\times S_\\alpha\\rightarrow S_n\\) by \\((B,\\sigma)\\mapsto \\operatorname{word}(B)\\sigma\\). The \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order \\(\\le_{\\alpha}\\) on \\(S_n\\) is the image of \\((B,\\sigma)\\le (B^\\prime,\\sigma^\\prime)\\) iff \\(\\sigma=\\sigma^\\prime\\) and \\(B\\le B^\\prime\\) in Bruhat order under the aforementioned bijection, which is isomorphic to \\(\\alpha!\\) isomorphic copies of \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\). If \\(w\\in\\mathbf R^n\\), define \\(\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\vdash n\\) as the composition of lengths of the weekly increasing components. An antichain in a poset is a set consisting of elements from different disjoint components. Lemma 3. Suppose \\(v\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) is stricly increasing and \\(w\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) weakly increasing, then \\(\\mathcal O(v,w)\\) is an antichain in the \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order where \\(\\alpha=\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\). Proof Suppose \\(\\pi\\in S_{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\tau=\\operatorname{word}(B)\\) for some \\(B\\in S_n/S_\\alpha\\). Suppose \\(i\\in B_a\\) and \\(j\\in B_b\\) for \\(i&lt;j\\) and \\(a&lt;b\\). We have \\(\\tau \\pi&lt; (i\\ j)\\tau \\pi\\). Next, we compute that\\[w\\cdot \\tau\\pi v-w\\cdot (i\\ j)\\tau \\pi v=(w_j-w_i)(v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(j)}-v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(i)})\\]Since \\(\\tau^{-1}(i)\\) is at a lower interval than \\(\\tau^{-1}(j)\\) (since \\(a&lt;b\\)) and \\(\\pi^{-1}\\) preserves these intervals, we have \\(v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(j)}&gt;v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(i)}\\). Since we have \\(w_i&lt;w_j\\) by assumption, we have \\(w\\cdot \\tau\\pi v&gt;w\\cdot (i\\ j)\\tau \\pi v\\). Therefore, if \\(\\sigma&lt;_{\\alpha}\\sigma^\\prime\\) then \\(w\\cdot \\sigma v&gt;w\\cdot \\sigma^\\prime v\\). Therefore, we can bound the sizes of antichains in the \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order. Sperner propertyWe use \\(q\\)-polynomials to bound the sizes of antichains. Specifically, we will make use of the Sperner property of \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\): it is a ranked poset where the set of elements of rank \\(r\\), for some fixed \\(r\\), forms an antichain of maximal size. The rank generating function of \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\) is the \\(q\\)-binomial coefficient \\(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\). Theorem 4. Let \\(v,w\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) where \\(v\\) has distinct coordinates, then\\[|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|\\le \\alpha!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\]where \\(\\alpha=\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\) and \\(M:\\mathbf{Z}[q]\\rightarrow\\mathbf Z\\) is the map that takes the maximum coefficient. Proof Since \\(|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|=|\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma v,\\tau w)|\\) for any \\(\\sigma,\\tau\\in S^n\\), we can assume \\(v\\) is strictly increasing and \\(w\\) weakly increasing. By the previous lemma, we have \\(\\mathcal{O}(v,w)\\) is an antichain in the \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order on \\(S_n\\), and hence also on \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\times S_\\alpha\\). By the Sperner property, we have this bound. Therefore, it suffice to bound the coefficients of \\(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\). Bounding coefficientsGiven \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\vdash n\\), then we say \\(\\beta\\) refines \\(\\alpha\\), written as \\(\\alpha\\prec \\beta\\), if \\(\\beta\\) is obtained from \\(\\alpha\\) by decomposing its entries. Lemma 5. If \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\vdash n\\) and \\(\\alpha\\prec \\beta\\), then \\(\\beta !M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\beta\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\le \\alpha! M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\). Proof Assume \\(\\beta=(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_{i-1},\\alpha_{i}-p,p,\\alpha_{i+1},\\dots,\\alpha_m)\\), then\\[\\beta!\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\beta\\end{bmatrix}_q=\\binom{\\alpha_i}{p}^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha_i\\\\ p\\end{bmatrix}_q \\alpha!\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\]The lemma follows from \\(M(fg)\\le f(1)M(g)\\). Eventually, with some lengthy calculations, we have \\(M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ k\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\le \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n}\\binom{n}{k}\\) for \\(n\\ge 0\\) and \\(2 &lt; k &lt; n-2\\). Theorem 1. For \\(n\\ge 3\\), we have\\[\\max\\{|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|: v\\in S,w\\in\\mathbf{R}^n\\}=2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor (n-2)!\\]where \\(S=\\{v\\in \\mathbf R^n: v\\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\ne 0, v\\mathrm{\\ has\\ distinct\\ coordinates}\\}\\). Proof If \\(\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\) has \\(1\\) part then obviously \\(|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|=0\\). Assume \\(\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\) has at least \\(2\\) parts.\\[\\begin{aligned}|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|&amp;\\le \\operatorname{comp}(w)!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\operatorname{comp}(w)\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\\\ &amp;\\le \\operatorname{max}_{\\alpha\\vdash n, \\ell(\\alpha)\\ge 2}\\alpha!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\\\ &amp;\\le \\operatorname{max}_{0&lt;k&lt;n}k!(n-k)!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ k\\end{bmatrix}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\]For \\(2&lt;k&lt;n-2\\), \\[k!(n-k)!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ k\\end{bmatrix}\\right)\\le k!(n-k)!\\frac{1}{n}\\binom{n}{k}=(n-1)!\\] We see that if \\(k=1\\) then \\(1!(n-1)!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}\\right)=(n-1)!\\) and if \\(k=2\\) then \\[2!(n-2)!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ 2\\end{bmatrix}\\right)=2(n-2)!\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor=\\left\\{\\begin{matrix}(n-1)!&amp;n\\mathrm{\\ odd}\\\\ n(n-2)!&amp; n\\mathrm{\\ even}\\end{matrix}\\right.\\]","link":"/archives/66165fd0/"},{"title":"Week 5: Semisimple Lie algebras, Weyl groups, Cartan subalgebras, and root systems","text":"“Mathematics requires a small dose, not of genius, but of an imaginative freedom which, in a larger dose, would be insanity. And if mathematicians tend to burn out early in their careers, it is probably because life has forced them to acquire too much common sense, thereby rendering them too sane to work. But by then they are sane enough to teach, so a use can still be found for them.” Angus K. Rodgers For this week, I’ll write about the theory of root systems, especially things related to Weyl groups, weight spaces and etc, for the purpose of my URA. This is because one of the objectives of my URA is to generalise my previous blog post about a fraction of an \\(S_n\\)-orbit on a hyperplane to Weyl groups. First, a Lie algebra is simple if it is of degree greater than \\(1\\) (so we are excluding the one dimensional abelian Lie algebras) and has no proper ideals, and a semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. Equivalently, a Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is semisimple if \\(\\mathrm{rad}(\\mathfrak{g})\\), the sum of all solvable ideals (or the maximal solvable ideal), is trivial. Any semisimple Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group \\(G\\). Let \\(\\mathrm{ad}:\\mathfrak{g}\\rightarrow \\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})\\) by \\((\\mathrm{ad} X)(Z)=[X,Z]\\) be the adjoint representation. Let \\(B:\\mathfrak{g}\\times \\mathfrak{g}\\rightarrow \\mathbf C\\) be the symmetric bilinear form defined by \\(B(X,Y)=\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathrm{ad}X\\mathrm{ad} Y)\\), called the Killing form which is invariant in the sense of \\(B([X,Y],Z)=B(X,[Y,Z])\\). Cartan’s criterion for semisimplicity says that a Lie algebra is semisimple iff the associated Killing form is nondegenerate. From now on, we let \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) be a semisimple Lie algebra over \\(\\mathbf C\\). We start by discussing the root–space decomposition \\(\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{h}\\oplus \\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi}\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha}\\) of semisimple Lie algebras. Root–space decompositionBefore we begin, we review some terminology. We say that \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is abelian if the Lie bracket is identically zero, and a subspace \\(\\mathfrak{i}\\) is an ideal if \\([X,Y]\\in\\mathfrak{i}\\) for all \\(X\\in \\mathfrak{g}\\) and \\(Y\\in\\mathfrak{i}\\). Examples include \\(Z(\\mathfrak{g})=\\{Z\\in\\mathfrak{g}:[X,Z]=0,\\forall X\\in\\mathfrak{g}\\}\\) called the center, \\(N_{\\mathfrak{g}}(k)=\\{X\\in\\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]\\in k,\\,\\forall K\\in k\\}\\) called the normaliser where \\(k\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathfrak g\\), and \\(C_{\\mathfrak g}(k)=\\{X\\in\\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]=0,\\,\\forall K\\in k\\}\\) called the centraliser where \\(k\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathfrak g\\). For ideals \\(\\mathfrak{i},\\mathfrak{j}\\) of \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\), define \\([\\mathfrak{i},\\mathfrak{j}]\\) to be the ideal spanned by \\([X,Y]\\) where \\(X\\in \\mathfrak{i},Y\\in \\mathfrak{j}\\). We say \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is nilpotent if the chain \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\ge [\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]\\ge [\\mathfrak{g},[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]]\\ge \\cdots\\) called the lower central series terminates in zero. We say \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is solvable if the chain \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\ge [\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]\\ge [[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}],[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]]\\ge \\cdots\\) called the derived series terminates in zero. We say \\(X\\in\\mathfrak{g}\\) is ad-nilpotent if \\(\\mathrm{ad}X\\) is a nilpotent endomorphism, and semisimple if \\(\\mathrm{ad}X\\) is diagonalisable. Definition 1. A subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\) of \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is Cartan if \\(\\mathfrak h\\) satisfies one of the equivalent conditions nilpotent and self-normalising (\\(N_\\mathfrak{g}(\\mathfrak h)=\\mathfrak h\\)) (if \\(\\mathfrak g\\) is f.d. over field of char. 0) a maximal subalgebra consisting of semisimple elements, A Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\) is abelian, and combine this with the fact that all elements are semisimple, we have \\(\\mathrm{ad}[\\mathfrak h]\\) are simultaneously diagonalisable and there is a direct sum decomposition \\(\\mathfrak{g}=\\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in \\mathfrak h^*}\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\) where \\(\\mathfrak{h}^*\\) is the dual space and \\(\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha}=\\{X\\in\\mathfrak g: (\\mathrm{ad}H)(X)=\\alpha (H)X,\\forall H\\in\\mathfrak h\\}\\). We have \\(\\mathfrak g_0=\\mathfrak h=C_{\\mathfrak g}(\\mathfrak h)\\). Let \\(\\Phi=\\{\\alpha\\in \\mathfrak{h}^*: \\alpha\\ne 0, \\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\ne 0\\}\\),\\[\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak h\\oplus\\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi}\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\]The elements of \\(\\Phi\\) are called roots, which there are only finitely many. The spaces \\(\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\) with \\(\\alpha\\) a root is called the root spaces. It turns out that root spaces all have dimension \\(1\\). Example 2. Let \\(E_{i,j}\\) be the matrix with \\(1\\) at \\((i,j)\\) and \\(0\\) elsewhere. Suppose \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_n(\\mathbf C): \\mathrm{tr}(M)=0\\}\\). We have the Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak h\\) consists of all diagonal matrices. Let \\(e_i\\in\\mathfrak h^*\\) output the \\(i\\)-th diagonal, then \\(\\mathrm{ad}(H)E_{i,j}=(e_i(H)-e_j(H))(E_{i,j})\\). Thus the roots are \\(\\alpha_{i,j}=e_{i}-e_{j}\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) and the corresponding root spaces are \\(\\mathbf CE_{i,j}\\). Suppose \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{2n+1}(\\mathbf C): M^{\\mathrm T}=-M\\}\\). The Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak h\\) consists of the block diagonal matrices with a \\(1\\)-by-\\(1\\) zero block and \\(n\\) \\(2\\)-by \\(2\\) blocks of the form\\[\\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; ih_j\\\\ -ih_j &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}\\]Let \\(e_j\\in\\mathfrak h^*\\) output \\(h_j\\). The roots are \\(\\pm e_i\\pm e_j\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) and \\(e_k\\) for \\(k\\). The root spaces are in Knapp II.1. Suppose \\(\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{2n}(\\mathbf C): M^\\mathrm{T}J=-JM\\}\\) where\\[J=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{0} &amp; I\\\\ -I&amp; \\mathbf{0}\\end{bmatrix}\\]The Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak h\\) consists of the diagonal matrices of the form\\[\\begin{bmatrix}H &amp; \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} &amp; -H\\end{bmatrix}\\]where \\(H\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_n(\\mathbf C)\\) is diagonal. Let \\(e_j\\in\\mathfrak{h}^*\\) output the the \\(j\\)-th diagonal of \\(H\\) in the above matrix. The roots are \\(\\pm e_i\\pm e_j\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) and \\(\\pm 2e_k\\) for \\(k\\). The root spaces are in Knapp II.1. Suppose \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{2n}(\\mathbf C): M^{\\mathrm T}=-M\\}\\). The Cartan subalgebra is similar to that of \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\mathbf C)\\) except the last zero block. The roots are \\(\\pm e_i\\pm e_j\\) with \\(i\\ne j\\). Note that we have \\([\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha},\\mathfrak{g}_{\\beta}]\\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha+\\beta}\\), and if \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Phi\\) and \\(\\alpha\\ne -\\beta\\) then \\(B(\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha},\\mathfrak g_{\\beta})=0\\). Also, we note that \\(\\Phi\\) spans \\(\\mathfrak h^*\\). In the next section, we define abstract root systems and formalize how we could obtain the Weyl group from \\(\\Phi\\). There is a different way we could define Weyl groups using maximal torus. Root systemsA root system is a configuration of vectors in the euclidean space that satisfies some geometric properties, which helps us with some classification problems in representation theory of Lie algebras. Definition 3. A root system is a Euclidean space \\(E\\) and a finite set of nonzero vectors \\(\\Phi\\subseteq E\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{Span}(\\Phi)=E\\), for \\(\\alpha\\in\\Phi\\), the only scalar multiples of \\(\\alpha\\) in \\(\\Phi\\) are \\(\\pm \\alpha\\), for any \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Phi\\), we have \\(\\langle\\beta,\\alpha \\rangle=2\\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\in\\mathbf Z\\) is an integer, for \\(\\alpha\\in\\Phi\\), we have the reflection of any \\(\\beta\\in\\Phi\\) about the hyperplane perpendicular to \\(\\alpha\\), i.e. \\[\\sigma_{\\alpha}(\\beta)=\\beta-\\langle \\beta,\\alpha\\rangle \\alpha=\\beta-2\\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\alpha\\]is still in \\(\\Phi\\). where \\((\\cdot,\\cdot)\\) is the standard inner product. The elements of \\(\\Phi\\) are roots. The rank of \\(\\Phi\\) is the dimension of \\(E\\). A morphism of root systems is a linear morphism between the Euclidean spaces which preserves \\(\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle\\). A root system \\(\\Phi\\) is reducible if \\(\\Phi=\\Phi_1\\cup\\Phi_2\\) s.t. \\((\\alpha,\\beta)=0\\) for all \\(\\alpha\\in\\Phi_1\\) and \\(\\beta\\in\\Phi_2\\). We can draw diagrams of root systems, for example, the following is an example of a root system called \\(G_2\\). This is in fact an irreducible root system. It does not decompose into disjoint unions that are orthogonal to each other. I credit this picture to this page of the wikipedia media repository. Here’s another picture of the root system \\(C_3\\) (arising from the sympletic Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{sp}_{6}\\)) drawn by my friend Maya, and a physical model we made together using coffee stirrers (it may not be the most accurate model but it’s hard work). The Weyl group of a root system \\(\\Phi\\) is the group of all reflections \\(W(\\Phi)=\\{\\sigma_{\\alpha}:\\alpha\\in\\Phi\\}\\le \\mathrm{GL}(E)\\). This is a Coxeter group, i.e. a group with a presentation of the form \\(\\langle r_1,\\dots,r_n\\mid (r_ir_j)^{m_{i,j}}\\rangle\\) where \\(m_{i,i}=1\\) and \\(m_{i,j}&gt;1\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) where \\(m_{i,j}=\\infty\\) when there are no relation. The Weyl group acts faithfully on the roots. For a Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak g\\) with root space decomposition \\(\\mathfrak h\\oplus \\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi}\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\), the set \\(\\Phi\\) is a root system. The Weyl chambers of a root system is the set of connected components of the complement of the union of all hyperplanes perpendicular to a root. Definition 4. A base for the root system is a subset \\(\\Delta\\subseteq\\Phi\\), whose elements are called simple roots, such that \\(\\Delta\\) is a basis for \\(E\\), and each root is a linear combination of \\(\\Delta\\) with integer coefficients such that the coefficients are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive, which are called the positive and negative roots with respect to \\(\\Delta\\). The height of a root with respect to \\(\\Delta\\) is the sum of all its coefficients in the basis \\(\\Delta\\). Equivalently, we can take a hyperplane not containing any root and define the positive roots as a fixed side, where the simple roots are the positive roots that cannot be written as the sum of two positive roots. The simple roots generate the Weyl group. The fundamental Weyl chamber associated to a base \\(\\Delta\\) is the set of points \\(\\{v\\in E:(\\alpha,v)&gt;0,\\forall \\alpha\\in \\Delta\\}\\). For each root \\(\\alpha\\), define the coroot \\(\\alpha^{\\lor}=\\frac{2}{\\langle \\alpha,\\alpha\\rangle}\\alpha\\), the set of coroots forms the dual of the root system \\(\\Phi^\\lor\\). Classification of root systemsFor \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Phi\\), since \\(\\cos(\\theta_{\\alpha,\\beta})=\\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)^2}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)(\\beta,\\beta)}\\), we have \\(\\langle \\alpha,\\beta\\rangle\\langle \\beta,\\alpha\\rangle=4\\cos^2(\\theta_{\\alpha,\\beta})\\le 4\\) which is an integer by assumption. Thus, we can list all the possibilities for the angles and for \\(\\langle \\alpha,\\beta\\rangle\\) If \\(\\Delta\\) is a base for \\(\\Phi\\), then the Cartan matrix associated to \\(\\Delta\\) is \\(C=(\\langle\\alpha_i,\\alpha_j \\rangle)\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{\\ell}(\\mathbf Z)\\) where \\(\\Delta=\\{\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_{\\ell}\\}\\) where \\(\\ell=|\\Delta|\\). Changing the order of roots just permutes the Cartan matrix’s rows and columns. Definition 5. The Dynkin diagram of a root system \\(\\Phi\\) with respect to a base \\(\\Delta\\) is a graph with undirected or directed edges with possibly multiple edges, such that the vertices are \\(\\Delta\\) and the number of edges between \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Delta\\) is \\(\\max(|\\langle\\alpha,\\beta \\rangle|,|\\langle \\beta,\\alpha\\rangle |)\\), directed towards the longer root if the number of edges is more than one. Obviously the root system is irreducible iff the Dynkin diagram is connected. Two root systems are isomorphic iff they have the same Dynkin diagram. A classification of all Dynkin diagrams can be found here. The bases for the root systems according to these classification can be found here. The simply laced (no multiple edges) Dynkin diagrams shows up in classification problems in many different areas in mathematics: labelled graphs, quivers, 2d conformal field theories, etc. See ADE classification. The Dynkin diagram also tells us information about the presentation of the Weyl group. For two distinct simple roots \\(s,r\\in\\Delta\\), the order \\(m\\) of \\(sr\\) in the presentation of the Weyl group is determined by the number of edges between their corresponding vertices in the Dynkin diagram. If there are no edges then \\(m=2\\), if there is one edge then \\(m=3\\), if there are two edges then \\(m=4\\), and if there are three edges then \\(m=6\\). Bruhat order on Coxeter groupsAn important step in Pawlowski’s paper was bounding \\(\\mathcal O(v,w)\\) using the antichains in the Bruhat order. The Bruhat order can in fact be defined over any Coxeter group. Definition 6. If \\(W\\) is a Coxeter group with standard generators \\(S\\), the Bruhat order on \\(W\\) is defined by \\(u\\le v\\) iff some substring of a \\(S\\)-reduced word for \\(v\\) is a \\(S\\)-reduced word for \\(u\\). As an example, we calculate the Weyl group of the root system arising from \\(\\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}\\) and its Bruhat order. From Example 2.3 earlier, we have \\(\\Phi=\\{\\pm e_i\\pm e_j:i\\ne j\\}\\cup\\{\\pm 2e_k:k\\}\\). To compute the presentation, we first choose a set of simple roots \\(\\Delta=\\{2e_1,e_2-e_1,e_3-e_2,\\dots,e_{n}-e_{n-1}\\}\\), and by computing the Cartan matrix, we derive the following Dynkin diagram which then determines the Weyl group \\(W(\\Phi)\\). Next, we find the reduced words in the group. For a word in this group, if two neighboring letters differ by an index greater than \\(1\\) then we cannot reduce the two letters further, and if they do not differ then they reduce to \\(1\\). Thus the reduced words are the concatonation of proper substrings of \\((s_1s_2)^4\\) and \\((s_ks_{k+1})^3\\) for \\(k\\ge 2\\) such that each neighboring pair of such block do not form the string \\((s_1s_2)^4\\) or \\((s_ks_{k+1})^3\\) for \\(k\\ge 2\\) and such that the two neighboring ends are not the same letter. For example, the word \\(s_3s_4s_3s_4s_5s_4s_5s_7s_6\\) is reduced. Observe that the reduced words are unique.","link":"/archives/59e692ad/"},{"title":"A topological proof of the insolvability of the quintic","text":"It is a well known fact that there is no general formula for quintic equations or algebraic equations of any higher degree, and a typical proof of this fact uses heavy machinery from Galois theory. However, there is a far more elementary but much less well known proof by V.I. Arnold using nothing more than basic knowledge of complex numbers and topology. Last week, I gave a talk on the Short Attention Span Math Seminars organized by the Pure Math Club at University of Waterloo. In my talk, I explained the main idea of his proof: moving the coefficients along loops to induce permutations of the roots. I also talked about how it could be turned into a rigorous proof using Riemann surfaces of algebraic functions and their monodromy groups, as well as its connections to Galois theory. In the end, I also discussed briefly some ideas related to this proof, such as topological Galois theory, Grothendieck’s Galois theory, and Grothendieck—Teichmüller theory. Here is the recording for my talk, and here are my slides. I’m indebted to Fred Akalin for his beautiful javascript program which visualizes the permutations of roots. He also has a very well written exposition on the same topic which you should definitely check out. I’m also very grateful for Leo Goldmakher and Henryk Zoladek for their wonderful expository papers on the topic, and most of all I’m very grateful to Faisal Al-Faisal for suggesting me to do this topic.","link":"/archives/31598439/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Combinatorics","slug":"Combinatorics","link":"/tags/Combinatorics/"},{"name":"Number Theory","slug":"Number-Theory","link":"/tags/Number-Theory/"},{"name":"Euclidean Geometry","slug":"Euclidean-Geometry","link":"/tags/Euclidean-Geometry/"},{"name":"Algebraic Geometry","slug":"Algebraic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Algebraic-Geometry/"},{"name":"Arithmetic Geometry","slug":"Arithmetic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Arithmetic-Geometry/"},{"name":"Lie Groups and Lie Algebras","slug":"Lie-Groups-and-Lie-Algebras","link":"/tags/Lie-Groups-and-Lie-Algebras/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Projects","slug":"Projects","link":"/categories/Projects/"},{"name":"This Week I Learned","slug":"This-Week-I-Learned","link":"/categories/This-Week-I-Learned/"},{"name":"Articles","slug":"Articles","link":"/categories/Articles/"},{"name":"articles","slug":"articles","link":"/categories/articles/"}]}
