I can be reached via email. I‚Äôm especially interested in algebraic geometry and homotopy theory. I started this math blog when I was a third year undergraduate student as a motivation for myself to learn and as a way of recording my learning progress. Here, I write about math that I recently learned and share my own expositions. Besides math, I also occasionally write about many things outside math that I enjoy. Outside of math, I‚Äôm very interested (but not really knowledgable) about a wide variety of things, including physics, computer graphics, music, and close-up magic. In my free time, I enjoy video games, music, anime, and abstract strategy board games (such as Go and Hex).","link":"/about/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"A topological proof of the insolvability of the quintic","text":"It is a well known fact that there is no general formula for quintic equations or algebraic equations of any higher degree, and a typical proof of this fact uses heavy machinery from Galois theory. However, there is a far more elementary but much less well known proof by V.I. Arnold using nothing more than basic knowledge of complex numbers and topology. Last week, I gave a talk on the Short Attention Span Math Seminars organized by the Pure Math Club at University of Waterloo. In my talk, I explained the main idea of his proof: moving the coefficients along loops to induce permutations of the roots. I also talked about how it could be turned into a rigorous proof using Riemann surfaces of algebraic functions and their monodromy groups, as well as its connections to Galois theory. In the end, I also discussed briefly some ideas related to this proof, such as topological Galois theory, Grothendieck‚Äôs Galois theory, and Grothendieck‚ÄìTeichm√ºller theory. Here is the recording for my talk, and here are my slides. I‚Äôm indebted to Fred Akalin for his beautiful javascript program which visualizes the permutations of roots. He also has a very well written exposition on the same topic which you should definitely check out. I‚Äôm also very grateful for Leo Goldmakher and Henryk Zoladek for their wonderful expository papers on the topic, and most of all I‚Äôm very grateful to Faisal Al-Faisal for suggesting me to do this topic.","link":"/archives/31598439/"},{"title":"Galois category and √âtale fundamental group","text":"I‚Äôm in a good mood today because it‚Äôs my birthday üéâ and I finally finished recording my final presentation for PMATH 965!

The Grassmannian is a space that parameterises linear subspaces, and the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian, the Chow ring, encodes data useful for intersection theory. In my talk, I introduced the definition of a Grassmannian as a manifold (via the Stiefel manifold or as a homogeneous space) and as a projective variety (via the Pl√ºcker embedding). Then I introduced the decomposition of Grassmannian into Schubert cells and Schubert varieties (by CW-decomposition and affine stratification). After that, I introduced the Chow ring. Here are the slides of my talk, and here is the video recording. This was actually quite a challenging topic for me since I only began to learn about Grassmannians this term, and I didn‚Äôt have a ton of time to prepare. In the end, I didn‚Äôt feel I understood Chern classes so I only briefly mentioned how it could be used for proving that there are \\(27\\) lines on a smooth cubic surface. Origianlly, I had hoped to also learn about generalized flag varieties, Bruhat decomposition, and Borel‚ÄìWeil‚ÄìBott theorem, but I really ran out of stamina. Perhaps I will find sometime to learn about them in the future.","link":"/archives/a5b2dbed/"},{"title":"Things I learned from CUMC 2022","text":"‚ÄúWhy did the two algebraic geometers get arrested at the airport?

It was really an intense week of learning. I learned a lot and met many smart and interesting people. So I wanted to write about the things I learned and the people I met during the conference. There were so many excellent talks but unfortunately I could only attend some of them. In particular, there are some very good ones in geometry, topology, representation theory, algebra, logic theory, etc. When Polynomials don‚Äôt Commute: An Introduction to Ore Extensions by Nick Priebe. Non-commutative algebra is a central topic in modern algebra research, which concerns objects such as non-commutative rings. Suppose \\(R\\) is a ring, \\(\\sigma:R\\rightarrow R\\) a homomorphism, \\(\\delta:R\\rightarrow R\\) a \\(\\sigma\\)-derivation i.e. a homomorphism s.t. \\(\\delta(rs)=\\sigma(r)\\delta(s)+\\delta(r)s\\), then an Ore extension or a skew polynomial ring is the noncommutative ring \\(R[x;\\sigma,\\delta]\\) where the multiplication satisfies \\(xr=\\sigma(r)x+\\delta(r)\\). Nick provided some examples of noncommutative rings that are useful in physics. He also introduced some basic results and open problems about their representations. I am actually quite curious about the relationship between noncommutative algebra and noncommutative geometry. A Brief Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory by Jacob Eater. Homotopy type theory is a new foundation of mathematics which is developed from intuitionist type theory. In HoTT, the fundamental objects are types, and we can build dependent types with \\(\\sum_{(x:A)}B(x)\\) (analogue of \\(\\exists x\\in A,B(x)\\)) and \\(\\prod_{(x:A)}B(x)\\) (analogue of \\(\\forall x\\in A,B(x)\\)). To avoid Russell‚Äôs paradox, we can build a tower of universes. Jacob also introduced Voevodsky‚Äôs Univalence axiom \\((A= B)\\simeq (A\\simeq B)\\) so isomorphic objects are equal. HoTT is very analogous to homotopy theory in the sense of its \\(\\infty\\)-groupoid structure. Currently there is a lot of research in their higher-categorical models and their application in computer proof assistants. Waring Squaring by Maya Gusak. A classical result in number theory is that each natural number is the sum of at most four squares. Waring‚Äôs problem asks for which \\(k\\in\\mathbb N\\) exists \\(s\\in\\mathbb Z^+\\) s.t. each \\(n\\in\\mathbb N\\) can be written as a sum \\(n=n_1^k+n_2^k+\\cdots+n_s^k\\), where \\(n_1,\\dots,n_s\\in\\mathbb N\\). To tackle this problem, mathematicians used so called circle method. Additionally, this method can be used to prove Vinogradov‚Äôs theorem (every odd natural number \\(n&gt;5\\) is the sum of three primes), but fails to solve Goldbach conjecture. ADE Classification for Quivers of Finite Representation Type by Xinrui You. A quiver is a multidigraph (i.e. a directed graph with multiple edges and loops allowed) which simulates underlying structure of a category. A representation of a quiver sends each vertex to a vector space or a module and each edge to a morphism. These representations decompose just as representations of finite groups. One fundamental result in the classification of quivers is Gabriel‚Äôs theorem. Gabriel‚Äôs theorem says that a quiver of finite representation type is a union of Dynkin graphs of type A, D, or E. The Nash Embedding Theorem for Tori in \\(3\\)-space by Diba Heydary. A fundamental result in Riemannian geometry is that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically (preserving the length of every path) embedded into a Euclidean space. Diba talked about a specific example of an embedding of a torus in the Euclidean \\(3\\)-space. A torus has a polygonal representation which can be used to create this embedding. Whitney embedding theorem is a similar result for differentiable manifolds. Dissection of Polyhedra and the Dehn invariant by James Bona-Landry. The Wallace‚ÄìBolyai‚ÄìGerwien theorem says that that two polygons can be dissected and transformed to each other iff they have the same area. The natural generalization of this question into \\(3\\) dimensions does not hold. This is due to the Dehn invariant \\(\\sum_i\\ell_i\\otimes \\theta_i\\in \\mathbb R\\otimes (\\mathbb R/2\\pi \\mathbb Z)\\). We can show that there are polyhedra that share same volume but has different Dehn invariant, which means they can not transform to each other via dissection. In fact the Dehn-Sydler theorem says that they can transform to each other via dissection iff they have the same volume and same Dehn invariant. The generalization for higher dimensions is still open. An Introduction to Linear Logic by Am√©lie Comtois. Linear logic is different from classical logic in that if \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) is used then \\(A\\) is no longer available anymore. She also talked about sequent calculus, which is a formal calculus of logic. Linear logic uses drastically different logical symbols than classical logic as well. Linear logic is an extension of classical logic, and classical logic can be realized in linear logic. Linear logic is thought of as the language of quantum theory. Moreover, I discussed with Am√©lie about category theory, and I learned from her about multicategories and higher categories. Exploring Quivers, Representations, and Varieties via Multisegments by Iretomiwa Ajala. This is another talk about quivers, and much more technical than that of Xinrui. Iretomiwa introduced multisegments, and discussed how they related to quivers of type A. He also mentions parabolic induction, which is a method of obtaining a representation of a reductive group from the representations of its parabolic subgroups. An Introduction to Coxeter Groups and the Properties of their Weak Order by Kimia Shaban. A very interesting talk on the combinatorial side of Coxeter groups. Coxeter groups are a type of groups generated by reflections. She discussed their classification, and the Sperner property of the weak order on Coxeter groups. In the end, she also talked about a conjecture she and her supervisor wish to disprove about the Sperner property of the weak order. Univariate Tropical Polynomials by Charlotte Lavoie-Bel. Tropical polynomical replace addition with the minimum function and multiplication by the usual addition, which makes it a semifield. Tropical polynomials can be graphed and they will have a cell-looking structure. They can be thought of as the limit of logarithm under base \\(0\\). They also have a different notion of roots than regular polynomials. We can consider zero locus of tropical polynomials i.e. tropical varieties. The tropical version of some classical algebraic geometry theorems such as Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, can be proven by combinatorial arguments. I like her quote that ‚Äútropical geometry is the combinatorial shadow of classical algebraic geometry‚Äù. There are many other excellent talks that I unfortunately did not attend, and I only wrote about some of the talks I went to. I also gave my own talk on Schubert calculus and cohomology of Grassmannians as the last student speaker of the conference, which you can view in a previous post.","link":"/archives/abde43b6/"},{"title":"Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoi","text":"‚ÄúComplex analysis is the good twin and real analysis the evil one: beautiful formulas and elegant theorems seem to blossom spontaneously in the complex domain, while toil and pathology rule the reals.‚Äù Charles Pugh This week I plan to start writing about what I‚Äôve learned in PMATH 965 on algebraic stacks. In the end of this semaster hopefully I will have written enough about them in this blog so that I can compile them into actual typesetted notes. We start by revisiting √©tale morphisms and introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Then, we will define important sites such as the big and small Zariski sites and √©tale sites as well as the fppf site. √âtale morphisms of schemesFirst, we revisit the definitions and properties of √©tale morphisms of schemes. Definition 3. A morphism of schemes \\(f:X\\rightarrow Y\\) is √©tale if one of these equivalent conditions holds \\(f\\) is smooth and locally quasi-finite, \\(f\\) is smooth and unramified, \\(f\\) is flat and unramified, \\(f\\) is locally of finite presentation and formally √©tale \\(f\\) is locally of finite presentation and locally a standard √©tale morphism, There are many more equivalent definitions of √©tale morphisms listed on wikipedia. Intuitively, I think of √©tale morphisms analogous to covering maps. We need this notion to define the √©tale topology which we will need to use later. As a side note, there is also something called the √©tale fundamental group, which also uses the notion of √©tale morphisms. We recall these properties of √©tale morphisms. Proposition 4. compotision of √©tale maps are √©tale, if \\(f:Y\\rightarrow X\\) is √©tale then its base change \\(Y\\times_XZ\\rightarrow Z\\) is √©tale, if \\(f:Y\\rightarrow X\\) and \\(g:Z\\rightarrow X\\) are √©tale and \\(g=f\\circ h\\) where \\(h:Z\\rightarrow Y\\), then \\(h\\) is √©tale given algebraically closed field \\(k\\) and \\(k\\)-algebra \\(A\\), then the morphism \\(\\mathrm{Spec}(A)\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Spec}(k)\\) is √©tale iff it is the disjoint union of spectra of finite separable field extensions of \\(k\\). Now, we are ready to define Grothendieck topology and sites. Grothendieck topology, sites, and topoiRecall that a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space \\(X\\) is a contravariant functor \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}\\), and a presheaf is a sheaf when \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow\\prod_{i}\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\rightrightarrows\\prod_{i,j}\\mathscr{F}(U_i\\cap U_j)\\) is an equalizer for every open cover \\(\\{U_{i}\\}\\) of any open \\(U\\subseteq X\\), which is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms. We want to extend this from \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) to any category \\(\\mathcal C\\). To do this, we need to add some additional structure on the category \\(\\mathcal C\\) so that its objects can be viewed as ‚Äúopen sets‚Äù and morphisms can be viewed as ‚Äúinclusions‚Äù. Grothendieck‚Äôs insight is that we don‚Äôt need the full strength of a topology to define sheaves, we only need intersections and a notion of when a collection of an open set forms an open cover of it. Definition 1. A Grothendieck topology on a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is the data of a set of coverings of \\(U\\), written as \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), for each object \\(U\\in \\mathcal C\\), where each covering \\(S\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) is a set of morphisms of \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(U\\) as targets, such that for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) for each isomorphism \\(\\varphi:V\\rightarrow U\\), we have \\(\\{\\varphi\\}\\in \\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) if \\(\\{V_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) and \\(\\{W_{i,j}\\rightarrow V_i\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(V_i)\\) for each \\(i\\), then \\(\\{W_{i,j}\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) for \\(\\{V_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) and \\(W\\rightarrow U\\), all \\(W\\times_UV_i\\) exists and \\(\\{W\\times_UV_i\\rightarrow W\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(W)\\) A category \\(\\mathcal C\\) equipped with a choice of Grothendieck topology, also denoted \\(\\mathcal C\\), is a site. A continuous functor between sites \\(f:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal D\\) is a functor between their underlying categories such that for all \\(\\{X_i\\rightarrow X\\}\\in \\mathrm{Cov}_{\\mathcal C}(X)\\) we have \\(\\{f(X_i)\\rightarrow f(X)\\}\\in \\mathrm{Cov}_{\\mathcal D}(f(X))\\), and it commutes with finite fibred products if they exist. For example, \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) for a topological space \\(X\\) can be made into a site using the usual notion of covering. We note that in \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) we have the fibered product \\(U\\times_X V=U\\cap V\\) for all open \\(U,V\\subseteq X\\), which agrees with the usual notion of intersection. For a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(X\\in\\mathcal C\\), the category of objects over \\(X\\), denoted \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is the category where objects are morphisms \\(Y\\rightarrow X\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) and morphisms between \\(Y_1\\rightarrow X\\) and \\(Y_2\\rightarrow X\\) are all morphisms \\(Y_1\\rightarrow Y_2\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) such that the obvious triangle commutes, i.e. \\((Y_1\\rightarrow Y_2\\rightarrow X)=Y_1\\rightarrow X\\). If \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a site, then \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) can be given a site structure, by letting \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U\\rightarrow X)\\) in \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) be \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\). The site \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is called the localization of the site \\(\\mathcal C\\) at \\(X\\). Suppose \\(X\\) is a scheme, then we say that the big Zariski (resp. big √©tale, resp. fppf) site, denoted \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{Zar}}\\) (resp. \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{√©t}}\\), resp. \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\)) of \\(X\\), is the site with the category \\(\\mathbf{Sch}/X\\) and \\(\\{Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) iff each \\(Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) is an open immersion with \\(Y=\\bigcup_i Y_i\\) (resp. each \\(Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) is √©tale with \\(\\coprod_i Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) surjective, resp. each \\(Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) is flat and locally of finite presentation with \\(\\coprod_i Y_i\\rightarrow Y\\) surjective). An element of \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U\\rightarrow X)\\) is called a Zariski cover (resp. √©tale cover, resp. fppf cover) of \\(U\\). The small Zariski site (resp. small √©tale site) of \\(X\\), denoted \\(X_{\\mathrm{Zar}}\\) (resp. \\(X_{\\mathrm{√©t}}\\)) is the site whose category is the full subcategory of \\(\\mathrm{Sch}/X\\) where each object \\(U\\rightarrow X\\) is an open immersion (resp. √©tale), and the coverings are the same as the big Zariski (resp. big √©tale) site. The small Zariski site of \\(X\\) is equivalent to the site \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\). Moreover, we have the following inclusions\\[\\{\\mathrm{Zariski\\ cover}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{√©tale\\ cover}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{fppf\\ cover}\\}\\]Next, we discuss presheaves and sheaves on a site. This whole business is to get new cohomology theories such as √©tale cohomology, because basic sheaf cohomology is insufficient for our needs. Definition 2. A presheaf (of sets) on a site \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a contravariant functor \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}\\), and a presheaf is a sheaf iff \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow\\prod_{i}\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\rightrightarrows\\prod_{i,j}\\mathscr{F}(U_i\\times_U U_j)\\) is an equalizer for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\). A presheaf is called separated if for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), the map \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow \\prod_i\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\) is injective. We write \\(\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) (resp. \\(\\mathrm{PSh}(\\mathcal C)\\)) for the category of sheaves (resp. presheaves) of the site \\(\\mathcal C\\). Note that a separated presheaf can be viewed as a presheaf that only satisfies one of the axioms of a sheaf, the identity axiom, but not necessaily the gluability axiom, therefore we have the obvious inclusions\\[\\{\\mathrm{sheaves}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{separated\\ presheaves}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{presheaves}\\}\\]all of which admits left adjoints, the composition of them being sheafification. Usually, we can formulate sheafification in terms of compatible germs, but since we are working over sites, it does not make sense to take a point in an object and take the product of stalks. The way we construct the adjoint from presheaves to separated presheaves is to map a presheaf \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) to \\(\\mathscr{F}^{\\mathrm s}(U)=\\mathscr{F}(U)/\\sim\\) where \\(a\\sim b\\) iff exists \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) such that \\(a,b\\) are mapped to the same element by the map \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow \\prod_i\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\). We can check that this is in fact a separated presheaf. All of the above works for (pre)sheaves of rings, abelian groups, etc. Definition 3. A topos is a category equivalent to \\(\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) for a site \\(\\mathcal C\\). A morphism of topoi \\(f:\\mathcal{T}_1\\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_2\\) is an adjoint pair \\(f^*\\dashv f_*\\) of functors \\(f^*:\\mathcal{T}_1\\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_2\\) and \\(f_*:\\mathcal{T}_2\\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_1\\) with a choice of natural isomorphism\\[\\Phi:\\mathrm{Mor}_{\\mathcal T_1}(f^*(-),-)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Mor}_{\\mathcal T_2}(-,f_*(-))\\]where each naturality here means \\(\\Phi\\) is natural in each of the two dashes, and \\(f^*\\) commutes with finite limits when they exist. Define composition in the obvious way. We remark that in the above definition, commuting with finite limits is equivalent to checking that \\(f^*\\) commutes with finite products and preserve equalizers. In many cases, though not always, a continuous functor between sites \\(f:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow \\mathcal D\\) induces a functor \\(f_*:\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal D)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) by \\(f_*(\\mathscr{F})(X)=\\mathscr{F}(f(X))\\), where the well-definedness follows from \\(\\mathscr{F}(f(U_i\\times_U U_j))=\\mathscr{F}(f(U_i)\\times_{f(U)} f(U_j))\\) for any \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), as illustrated by the diagram This induced functor does not always admit a left adjoint. However, we have the following theorem Proposition 4. If \\(\\mathcal C,\\mathcal D\\) are sites with small underlying categories, then the functor \\(f_*:\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal D)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\) induced by a continuous functor \\(f:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow \\mathcal D\\) admits a left adjoint \\(f^*:\\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal C)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Sh}(\\mathcal D)\\). If, further, that finite limits in \\(\\mathcal C\\) are representable and \\(f\\) commutes with them, then \\(f^*\\) commutes with finite limits. Proof We construct this functor concretely. For each \\(U\\in\\mathcal D\\), let \\(\\mathcal I_U\\) be the category where objects are pairs \\(\\langle V,\\rho\\rangle\\) where \\(V\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\rho\\in \\mathrm{Mor}_\\mathcal{D}(U,f(V))\\), and a morphism \\(g:\\langle V_1,\\rho_1\\rangle \\rightarrow \\langle V_2,\\rho_2\\rangle\\) is a morphism \\(g:V_1\\rightarrow V_2\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) such that \\((fg)\\circ\\rho_1=\\rho_2\\). We define\\[f^*(\\mathscr{F})(U)=\\lim_{\\stackrel{\\longrightarrow}{\\langle V,\\rho\\rangle\\in\\mathcal I_{U}^\\mathrm{op}}}\\mathscr{F}(V)\\]and for each \\(h:U_1\\rightarrow U_2\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\), there is functor \\(\\mathcal I_{U_2}\\rightarrow \\mathcal I_{U_1}\\) given by \\(\\langle V,\\rho\\rangle\\mapsto \\langle V,\\rho\\circ h\\rangle\\) which induces a morphism \\(f^*(\\mathscr{F})(U_2)\\rightarrow f^*(\\mathscr{F})(U_1)\\). We can check that this is well-defined.","link":"/archives/46fca3c5/"},{"title":"Fppf site, faithfully flat descent, and fibred categories","text":"‚ÄúSerious mathematics (contrary to a popular misconception) is not ‚Äòabout‚Äô proofs and logic any more than serious literature is ‚Äòabout‚Äô grammar, or music is ‚Äòabout‚Äô notes.‚Äù Ethan D. Bloch In this week we discuss fppf sites (recall that we defined \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\) in last week) and faithfully flat descent. This will help us to build our way to the definition of a stack. The idea of faifully flat descent is that a certain property of schemes can be descended via a cartesian square with a fppf side. The important result we are building towards is that for any scheme \\(X\\), the functor of points \\(\\mathscr{H}_X\\) is a sheaf on the fppf site of \\(X\\). After this, we can talk about fibred categories. Fibred categories plus descents is categorical stacks, plus geometry is algebraic stacks. Fppf site and faithfully flat descentWe recall that a map of schemes is fppf iff it is faithfully flat (i.e. flat and surjective) and locally of finite presentation, and recall that the fppf site \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\) consists of the fppf covers, i.e. the jointly surjective, flat and locally of finite presentation families of morphisms. We have the following problem. Theorem 1. Suppose \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\) is a morphism of schemes, the functor of points \\(\\mathscr{H}_X\\) is a sheaf on \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/Y)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\). Proof Proof is very long, see Theorem 4.1.2 in Olsson‚Äôs book. This theorem has a very long proof and the reason it is important is delayed to later. Another important result is faithfully flat descent. The idea is, if \\(P\\) is some property of morphism of schemes, given morphisms of schemes \\(f_1:X_1\\rightarrow Y_1\\) and \\(f_2:X_2\\rightarrow Y_2\\) and suppose there is a commutative diagram then frequently \\(f_1\\) has property \\(P\\) iff \\(f_2\\) does. We say that \\(P\\) is local on the base (target) for the fppf topology (et al. Zariski, etc.) if \\(f_1\\) has property \\(P\\) implies \\(f_2\\) does. Examples of properties that are local on the base for the fppf topology inlcude: surjective, locally of finite type, locally of finite presentation, universally closed/open, separated, proper, etc. The full proof can be found on stacks project. Fibred categoriesFor a category \\(\\mathcal C\\), a category over \\(\\mathcal C\\) is some category \\(\\mathcal F\\) equipped with a functor \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal C\\). We draw diagrams with the notation \\(\\xi\\mapsto U\\) to mean \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)=U\\), and a diagram of the form commutes iff \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi=f\\). Moreover, we say that a morphism \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) in \\(\\mathcal F\\) is cartesian if for all \\(\\zeta\\in\\mathcal F\\) and morphisms \\(\\psi:\\zeta \\rightarrow \\eta\\) and \\(h:\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\zeta)\\rightarrow \\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)\\) such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi \\circ h=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\psi\\), there exists unique \\(\\theta:\\zeta\\rightarrow\\xi\\) such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\theta=h\\) and \\(\\psi=\\phi\\circ\\theta\\), as indicated in the diagram and when \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) is cartesian, we say that \\(\\xi\\) is a pullback of \\(\\eta\\) (to \\(U\\) along \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi\\)). This diagram is sometimes known as the ‚Äúuniversal property‚Äù of cartesian morphisms. Note that given two pullbacks \\(\\phi_1:\\xi_1\\rightarrow\\eta\\) and \\(\\phi_2:\\xi_2\\rightarrow\\eta\\) then substitute \\(\\psi=\\xi_i\\) for \\(i=1,2\\) will give us an isomorphism \\(\\xi_1\\cong\\xi_2\\). Thus, pullbacks are unique up to a unique isomorphism. Note that in SGA1 the definition of cartesian arrow is different and this definition is sometimes known as strongly cartesian. Next, we introduce the following properties, which is easy to check, Proposition 2. Let \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal C\\) be a category over the category \\(\\mathcal C\\). composite of cartesian arrows are cartesian, if \\(\\psi:\\eta\\rightarrow \\zeta\\) and \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) are arrows in \\(\\mathcal F\\) with \\(\\psi\\) cartesian, then \\(\\phi\\) is cartesian iff \\(\\psi\\circ\\phi\\) is, if \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) is an arrow and \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi\\) is an isomorphism, then \\(\\phi\\) is cartesian iff it is an isomorphism, With these knowledge, we can introduce fibred categories. Fibred categories are used to provide a general framework for descent theory. They formalize various situations in geometry and algebra where pullbacks of objects are defined. A motivating example is the category of vector bundles on a topological space. Definition 3. A fibred category over a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a category \\(\\mathcal F\\) over \\(\\mathcal C\\) such that for each \\(f:U\\rightarrow V\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) where \\(V=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\eta)\\) for some \\(\\eta\\in \\mathcal F\\), there exists \\(\\xi\\in\\mathcal F\\) with \\(U=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)\\) and cartesian arrow \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow\\eta\\) such that \\(f=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi\\). Suppose \\(\\mathcal F,\\mathcal G\\) are fibred categories over \\(\\mathcal C\\), then a morphism of fibred categories \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow \\mathcal G\\) is a functor such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal G}\\circ \\mathscr{F}=\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\) and \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) sends cartesian arrows to cartesian arrows. Suppose \\(\\mathcal F\\) is a category over \\(\\mathcal C\\) and \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\), write \\(\\mathcal F(U)\\) as the subcategory of \\(\\mathcal F\\) whose objects are \\(\\xi\\in\\mathcal F\\) such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}(\\xi)=U\\) and morphisms are \\(\\phi:\\xi\\rightarrow \\eta\\) where \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal F}\\phi=\\mathbf{1}_U\\). If \\(\\mathscr{F},\\mathscr{G}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow \\mathcal G\\) are morphisms of fibred categories, a base-preserving natural transformation \\(\\alpha:\\mathscr{F}\\rightarrow \\mathscr{G}\\) is a natural transformation such that for all \\(u\\in\\mathcal F\\) we have \\(\\alpha(u):\\mathscr{F}(u)\\rightarrow \\mathscr{G}(u)\\) is such that \\(\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{F}(u))=\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{G}(u))\\) and \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal G}\\alpha(u)=\\mathbf 1_{\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{F}(u))}\\), i.e. \\(\\alpha(u)\\) is a morphism in \\(\\mathcal G(\\mathscr{P}_\\mathcal{G}(\\mathscr{F}(u)))\\). Denote by \\(\\mathrm{MOR}_{\\mathcal C}(\\mathcal F,\\mathcal G)\\) the category whose objects are morphisms of fibred categories and morphisms are base-preserving natural transformations. For a morphism of fibred categories \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal G\\) over \\(\\mathcal C\\) and \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\), we write \\(\\mathscr{F}_U:\\mathcal F(U)\\rightarrow \\mathcal G(U)\\) to denote the functor where \\(\\mathscr{F}_U(\\xi)=\\mathscr{F}(\\xi)\\) and \\(\\mathscr{F}_U\\phi=\\mathscr{F}\\phi\\). Thus in a fibred category we can pullback objects along any arrow. For example, for a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(X\\in\\mathcal C\\), we have \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is fibred over \\(\\mathcal C\\) via \\(\\mathscr{P}_{\\mathcal C/X}:\\mathcal C/X\\rightarrow \\mathcal C\\) given by \\((Y\\rightarrow X)\\mapsto Y\\) and morphisms are mapped to themsleves. It should be easy to check that this is well-defined. Why do we need fibred categories? Suppose \\(f:X\\rightarrow Y\\) is a morphism of schemes. For any morphism of schemes \\(t:T\\rightarrow Y\\) we can form a fibred product \\(T\\times_Y X\\) which is only unique up to a unique isomorphism. Thus implicitly there is a choice being made. This becomes a technical obstacle in developing the theory of stacks, and fibred categories are used to address this problem. For more detail, see Example 3.1.5 in Olsson‚Äôs book. The collection of categories fibred over a fixed category is an example of a \\(2\\)-category. Roughly speaking, a \\(2\\)-category is a category where the morphisms between two objects form a category. However, we will not use higher categorical language. Lemma 4. Let \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal F\\rightarrow\\mathcal G\\) be a morphism of fibred categories over \\(\\mathcal C\\), \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) is fully faithful (as a functor) iff \\(\\mathscr{F}_U:\\mathcal F(U)\\rightarrow \\mathcal G(U)\\) is fully faithful for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\), \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) is an equivalence (of categories) iff \\(\\mathscr{F}_U:\\mathcal F(U)\\rightarrow \\mathcal G(U)\\) is an equivalence for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\). Proof Lemma 3.1.8, Olsson. Recall the classical Yoneda lemma: for each object \\(A\\in\\mathcal C\\) we have a natural isomorphism between the collection of natural transformations \\(\\mathrm{Nat}(\\mathscr{F},\\mathscr{H}^A)\\), and the set \\(\\mathscr{F}(A)\\). This point of view is crucial for the development of algebraic spaces, and also for fibred categories we need a variant of this lemma. Theorem 5 (\\(2\\)-Yoneda lemma). Suppose \\(\\mathcal F\\) is fibred over \\(\\mathcal C\\), there is an equivalence\\[\\mathrm{MOR}_{\\mathcal C}(\\mathcal C/X,\\mathcal F)\\cong \\mathcal F(X)\\]given by \\(\\mathscr{F}\\mapsto \\mathscr{F}(\\mathbf 1_{X})\\). Proof Proposition 3.2.2 Olsson. It is often useful to think of a fibred category as the collection of categories \\(\\mathcal{F}(U)\\) with a pullback functor. Thus, we introduce split fibred categories. We will not go over the details of the rigorous definition, but the reader can check 3.3.1 in Olsson‚Äôs book.","link":"/archives/9693c172/"},{"title":"Galois cohomology and Mordell‚ÄîWeil theorem","text":"‚ÄúIn mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.‚Äù George Cantor This week I finally finished my final project for my PMATH 499 reading course in arithmetic geometry. My project is called ‚ÄúGalois cohomology and weak Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem‚Äù, which is available here. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \\(k\\) with an algebraic closure \\(K\\), the Galois group \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit of topological Galois groups \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \\(L/k\\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \\(G\\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \\(G\\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \\(G\\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation. My final project focuses on the proof of the weak Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem, which states that for any elliptic curve \\(E\\), the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is finite for all \\(n\\ge 2\\). This is an important step in the proof of the Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem which states the elliptic curve groups are finitely generated. The proof of Mordell‚ÄìWeil involves in applying an infinite descent argument to weak Mordell‚ÄìWeil, which I will not go into detail. The motivating observation is that we have an exact sequence of topological \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\)-modules \\[\\mathbf{0}\\rightarrow E(K)[n]\\rightarrow E(K)\\xrightarrow{n}E(K)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{0}\\]This short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which we truncate after the first cohomology groups. The first cohomology group can be viewed as the group of crossed homomorphisms module the principal crossed homomorphisms, where a crossed homomorphism is some \\(f\\) with \\(f(gh)=gf(h)+f(g)\\) for all \\(g,h\\) and a principal crossed homomorphism is a homomorphism where there exists \\(m\\) with \\(f(g)=gm-m\\) for all \\(g\\). This can be verified by just computing out the differential. Next, we define the \\(n\\)-Selmer groups and the Tate-Shafarevich group, which is applied to the induced exact sequence we just found in order to obtain a better bound for the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\). Finally, the finiteness of \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is obtained from the finiteness of the Selmer groups.","link":"/archives/7dbb66b9/"},{"title":"Semisimple Lie algebras, Weyl groups, Cartan subalgebras, and root systems","text":"‚ÄúMathematics requires a small dose, not of genius, but of an imaginative freedom which, in a larger dose, would be insanity.

Rodgers For this week, I‚Äôll write about the theory of root systems, especially things related to Weyl groups, weight spaces and etc, for the purpose of my URA. This is because one of the objectives of my URA is to generalise my previous blog post about a fraction of an \\(S_n\\)-orbit on a hyperplane to Weyl groups. First, a Lie algebra is simple if it is of degree greater than \\(1\\) (so we are excluding the one dimensional abelian Lie algebras) and has no proper ideals, and a semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. Equivalently, a Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is semisimple if \\(\\mathrm{rad}(\\mathfrak{g})\\), the sum of all solvable ideals (or the maximal solvable ideal), is trivial. Any semisimple Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group \\(G\\). Let \\(\\mathrm{ad}:\\mathfrak{g}\\rightarrow \\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})\\) by \\((\\mathrm{ad} X)(Z)=[X,Z]\\) be the adjoint representation. Let \\(B:\\mathfrak{g}\\times \\mathfrak{g}\\rightarrow \\mathbf C\\) be the symmetric bilinear form defined by \\(B(X,Y)=\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathrm{ad}X\\mathrm{ad} Y)\\), called the Killing form which is invariant in the sense of \\(B([X,Y],Z)=B(X,[Y,Z])\\). Cartan‚Äôs criterion for semisimplicity says that a Lie algebra is semisimple iff the associated Killing form is nondegenerate. From now on, we let \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) be a semisimple Lie algebra over \\(\\mathbf C\\). We start by discussing the root‚Äìspace decomposition \\(\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{h}\\oplus \\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi}\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha}\\) of semisimple Lie algebras. Root‚Äìspace decompositionBefore we begin, we review some terminology. We say that \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is abelian if the Lie bracket is identically zero, and a subspace \\(\\mathfrak{i}\\) is an ideal if \\([X,Y]\\in\\mathfrak{i}\\) for all \\(X\\in \\mathfrak{g}\\) and \\(Y\\in\\mathfrak{i}\\). Examples include \\(Z(\\mathfrak{g})=\\{Z\\in\\mathfrak{g}:[X,Z]=0,\\forall X\\in\\mathfrak{g}\\}\\) called the center, \\(N_{\\mathfrak{g}}(k)=\\{X\\in\\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]\\in k,\\,\\forall K\\in k\\}\\) called the normaliser where \\(k\\) is a subspace of \\(\\mathfrak g\\), and \\(C_{\\mathfrak g}(k)=\\{X\\in\\mathfrak{g}:[X,K]=0,\\,\\forall K\\in k\\}\\) called the centraliser where \\(k\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathfrak g\\). For ideals \\(\\mathfrak{i},\\mathfrak{j}\\) of \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\), define \\([\\mathfrak{i},\\mathfrak{j}]\\) to be the ideal spanned by \\([X,Y]\\) where \\(X\\in \\mathfrak{i},Y\\in \\mathfrak{j}\\). We say \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is nilpotent if the chain \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\ge [\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]\\ge [\\mathfrak{g},[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]]\\ge \\cdots\\) called the lower central series terminates in zero. We say \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is solvable if the chain \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\ge [\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]\\ge [[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}],[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]]\\ge \\cdots\\) called the derived series terminates in zero. We say \\(X\\in\\mathfrak{g}\\) is ad-nilpotent if \\(\\mathrm{ad}X\\) is a nilpotent endomorphism, and semisimple if \\(\\mathrm{ad}X\\) is diagonalisable. Definition 1. A subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\) of \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is Cartan if \\(\\mathfrak h\\) satisfies one of the equivalent conditions nilpotent and self-normalising (\\(N_\\mathfrak{g}(\\mathfrak h)=\\mathfrak h\\)) (if \\(\\mathfrak g\\) is f.d. over field of char. 0) a maximal subalgebra consisting of semisimple elements, A Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\) is abelian, and combine this with the fact that all elements are semisimple, we have \\(\\mathrm{ad}[\\mathfrak h]\\) are simultaneously diagonalisable and there is a direct sum decomposition \\(\\mathfrak{g}=\\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in \\mathfrak h^*}\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\) where \\(\\mathfrak{h}^*\\) is the dual space and \\(\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha}=\\{X\\in\\mathfrak g: (\\mathrm{ad}H)(X)=\\alpha (H)X,\\forall H\\in\\mathfrak h\\}\\). We have \\(\\mathfrak g_0=\\mathfrak h=C_{\\mathfrak g}(\\mathfrak h)\\). Let \\(\\Phi=\\{\\alpha\\in \\mathfrak{h}^*: \\alpha\\ne 0, \\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\ne 0\\}\\),\\[\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak h\\oplus\\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi}\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\]The elements of \\(\\Phi\\) are called roots, which there are only finitely many. The spaces \\(\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\) with \\(\\alpha\\) a root is called the root spaces. It turns out that root spaces all have dimension \\(1\\). Example 2. Let \\(E_{i,j}\\) be the matrix with \\(1\\) at \\((i,j)\\) and \\(0\\) elsewhere. Suppose \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_n(\\mathbf C): \\mathrm{tr}(M)=0\\}\\). We have the Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak h\\) consists of all diagonal matrices. Let \\(e_i\\in\\mathfrak h^*\\) output the \\(i\\)-th diagonal, then \\(\\mathrm{ad}(H)E_{i,j}=(e_i(H)-e_j(H))(E_{i,j})\\). Thus the roots are \\(\\alpha_{i,j}=e_{i}-e_{j}\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) and the corresponding root spaces are \\(\\mathbf CE_{i,j}\\). Suppose \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{2n+1}(\\mathbf C): M^{\\mathrm T}=-M\\}\\). The Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak h\\) consists of the block diagonal matrices with a \\(1\\)-by-\\(1\\) zero block and \\(n\\) \\(2\\)-by \\(2\\) blocks of the form\\[\\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; ih_j\\\\ -ih_j &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}\\]Let \\(e_j\\in\\mathfrak h^*\\) output \\(h_j\\). The roots are \\(\\pm e_i\\pm e_j\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) and \\(e_k\\) for \\(k\\). The root spaces are in Knapp II.1. Suppose \\(\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{2n}(\\mathbf C): M^\\mathrm{T}J=-JM\\}\\) where\\[J=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{0} &amp; I\\\\ -I&amp; \\mathbf{0}\\end{bmatrix}\\]The Cartan subalgebra \\(\\mathfrak h\\) consists of the diagonal matrices of the form\\[\\begin{bmatrix}H &amp; \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} &amp; -H\\end{bmatrix}\\]where \\(H\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_n(\\mathbf C)\\) is diagonal. Let \\(e_j\\in\\mathfrak{h}^*\\) output the the \\(j\\)-th diagonal of \\(H\\) in the above matrix. The roots are \\(\\pm e_i\\pm e_j\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) and \\(\\pm 2e_k\\) for \\(k\\). The root spaces are in Knapp II.1. Suppose \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\mathbf C)=\\{M\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{2n}(\\mathbf C): M^{\\mathrm T}=-M\\}\\). The Cartan subalgebra is similar to that of \\(\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\mathbf C)\\) except the last zero block. The roots are \\(\\pm e_i\\pm e_j\\) with \\(i\\ne j\\). Note that we have \\([\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha},\\mathfrak{g}_{\\beta}]\\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha+\\beta}\\), and if \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Phi\\) and \\(\\alpha\\ne -\\beta\\) then \\(B(\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha},\\mathfrak g_{\\beta})=0\\). Also, we note that \\(\\Phi\\) spans \\(\\mathfrak h^*\\). In the next section, we define abstract root systems and formalize how we could obtain the Weyl group from \\(\\Phi\\). There is a different way we could define Weyl groups using maximal torus. Root systemsA root system is a configuration of vectors in the euclidean space that satisfies some geometric properties, which helps us with some classification problems in representation theory of Lie algebras. Definition 3. A root system is a Euclidean space \\(E\\) and a finite set of nonzero vectors \\(\\Phi\\subseteq E\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{Span}(\\Phi)=E\\), for \\(\\alpha\\in\\Phi\\), the only scalar multiples of \\(\\alpha\\) in \\(\\Phi\\) are \\(\\pm \\alpha\\), for any \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Phi\\), we have \\(\\langle\\beta,\\alpha \\rangle=2\\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\in\\mathbf Z\\) is an integer, for \\(\\alpha\\in\\Phi\\), we have the reflection of any \\(\\beta\\in\\Phi\\) about the hyperplane perpendicular to \\(\\alpha\\), i.e. \\[\\sigma_{\\alpha}(\\beta)=\\beta-\\langle \\beta,\\alpha\\rangle \\alpha=\\beta-2\\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\alpha\\]is still in \\(\\Phi\\). where \\((\\cdot,\\cdot)\\) is the standard inner product. The elements of \\(\\Phi\\) are roots. The rank of \\(\\Phi\\) is the dimension of \\(E\\). A morphism of root systems is a linear morphism between the Euclidean spaces which preserves \\(\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle\\). A root system \\(\\Phi\\) is reducible if \\(\\Phi=\\Phi_1\\cup\\Phi_2\\) s.t. \\((\\alpha,\\beta)=0\\) for all \\(\\alpha\\in\\Phi_1\\) and \\(\\beta\\in\\Phi_2\\). We can draw diagrams of root systems, for example, the following is an example of a root system called \\(G_2\\). This is in fact an irreducible root system. It does not decompose into disjoint unions that are orthogonal to each other. I credit this picture to this page of the wikipedia media repository. Here‚Äôs another picture of the root system \\(C_3\\) (arising from the sympletic Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak{sp}_{6}\\)) drawn by my friend Maya, and a physical model we made together using coffee stirrers (it may not be the most accurate model but it‚Äôs hard work). The Weyl group of a root system \\(\\Phi\\) is the group of all reflections \\(W(\\Phi)=\\{\\sigma_{\\alpha}:\\alpha\\in\\Phi\\}\\le \\mathrm{GL}(E)\\). This is a Coxeter group, i.e. a group with a presentation of the form \\(\\langle r_1,\\dots,r_n\\mid (r_ir_j)^{m_{i,j}}\\rangle\\) where \\(m_{i,i}=1\\) and \\(m_{i,j}&gt;1\\) for \\(i\\ne j\\) where \\(m_{i,j}=\\infty\\) when there are no relation. The Weyl group acts faithfully on the roots. For a Lie algebra \\(\\mathfrak g\\) with root space decomposition \\(\\mathfrak h\\oplus \\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in\\Phi}\\mathfrak g_{\\alpha}\\), the set \\(\\Phi\\) is a root system. The Weyl chambers of a root system is the set of connected components of the complement of the union of all hyperplanes perpendicular to a root. Definition 4. A base for the root system is a subset \\(\\Delta\\subseteq\\Phi\\), whose elements are called simple roots, such that \\(\\Delta\\) is a basis for \\(E\\), and each root is a linear combination of \\(\\Delta\\) with integer coefficients such that the coefficients are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive, which are called the positive and negative roots with respect to \\(\\Delta\\). The height of a root with respect to \\(\\Delta\\) is the sum of all its coefficients in the basis \\(\\Delta\\). Equivalently, we can take a hyperplane not containing any root and define the positive roots as a fixed side, where the simple roots are the positive roots that cannot be written as the sum of two positive roots. The simple roots generate the Weyl group. The fundamental Weyl chamber associated to a base \\(\\Delta\\) is the set of points \\(\\{v\\in E:(\\alpha,v)&gt;0,\\forall \\alpha\\in \\Delta\\}\\). For each root \\(\\alpha\\), define the coroot \\(\\alpha^{\\lor}=\\frac{2}{\\langle \\alpha,\\alpha\\rangle}\\alpha\\), the set of coroots forms the dual of the root system \\(\\Phi^\\lor\\). Classification of root systemsFor \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Phi\\), since \\(\\cos(\\theta_{\\alpha,\\beta})=\\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)^2}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)(\\beta,\\beta)}\\), we have \\(\\langle \\alpha,\\beta\\rangle\\langle \\beta,\\alpha\\rangle=4\\cos^2(\\theta_{\\alpha,\\beta})\\le 4\\) which is an integer by assumption. Thus, we can list all the possibilities for the angles and for \\(\\langle \\alpha,\\beta\\rangle\\) If \\(\\Delta\\) is a base for \\(\\Phi\\), then the Cartan matrix associated to \\(\\Delta\\) is \\(C=(\\langle\\alpha_i,\\alpha_j \\rangle)\\in\\mathrm{Mat}_{\\ell}(\\mathbf Z)\\) where \\(\\Delta=\\{\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_{\\ell}\\}\\) where \\(\\ell=|\\Delta|\\). Changing the order of roots just permutes the Cartan matrix‚Äôs rows and columns. Definition 5. The Dynkin diagram of a root system \\(\\Phi\\) with respect to a base \\(\\Delta\\) is a graph with undirected or directed edges with possibly multiple edges, such that the vertices are \\(\\Delta\\) and the number of edges between \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\Delta\\) is \\(\\max(|\\langle\\alpha,\\beta \\rangle|,|\\langle \\beta,\\alpha\\rangle |)\\), directed towards the longer root if the number of edges is more than one. Obviously the root system is irreducible iff the Dynkin diagram is connected. Two root systems are isomorphic iff they have the same Dynkin diagram. A classification of all Dynkin diagrams can be found here. The bases for the root systems according to these classification can be found here. The simply laced (no multiple edges) Dynkin diagrams shows up in classification problems in many different areas in mathematics: labelled graphs, quivers, 2d conformal field theories, etc. See ADE classification. The Dynkin diagram also tells us information about the presentation of the Weyl group. For two distinct simple roots \\(s,r\\in\\Delta\\), the order \\(m\\) of \\(sr\\) in the presentation of the Weyl group is determined by the number of edges between their corresponding vertices in the Dynkin diagram. If there are no edges then \\(m=2\\), if there is one edge then \\(m=3\\), if there are two edges then \\(m=4\\), and if there are three edges then \\(m=6\\). Bruhat order on Coxeter groupsAn important step in Pawlowski‚Äôs paper was bounding \\(\\mathcal O(v,w)\\) using the antichains in the Bruhat order. The Bruhat order can in fact be defined over any Coxeter group. Definition 6. If \\(W\\) is a Coxeter group with standard generators \\(S\\), the Bruhat order on \\(W\\) is defined by \\(u\\le v\\) iff some substring of a \\(S\\)-reduced word for \\(v\\) is a \\(S\\)-reduced word for \\(u\\). As an example, we calculate the Weyl group of the root system arising from \\(\\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}\\) and its Bruhat order. From Example 2.3 earlier, we have \\(\\Phi=\\{\\pm e_i\\pm e_j:i\\ne j\\}\\cup\\{\\pm 2e_k:k\\}\\). To compute the presentation, we first choose a set of simple roots \\(\\Delta=\\{2e_1,e_2-e_1,e_3-e_2,\\dots,e_{n}-e_{n-1}\\}\\), and by computing the Cartan matrix, we derive the following Dynkin diagram which then determines the Weyl group \\(W(\\Phi)\\). Next, we find the reduced words in the group. For a word in this group, if two neighboring letters differ by an index greater than \\(1\\) then we cannot reduce the two letters further, and if they do not differ then they reduce to \\(1\\). Thus the reduced words are the concatonation of proper substrings of \\((s_1s_2)^4\\) and \\((s_ks_{k+1})^3\\) for \\(k\\ge 2\\) such that each neighboring pair of such block do not form the string \\((s_1s_2)^4\\) or \\((s_ks_{k+1})^3\\) for \\(k\\ge 2\\) and such that the two neighboring ends are not the same letter. For example, the word \\(s_3s_4s_3s_4s_5s_4s_5s_7s_6\\) is reduced. Observe that the reduced words are unique.","link":"/archives/59e692ad/"},{"title":"Localization of categories and derived category","text":"‚ÄúAlgebraic geometry seems to have acquired the reputation of being esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics. In one respect this last point is accurate.‚Äù David Mumford Continuing last week, we are finally going to define the derived category \\(D(\\mathcal A)\\) for an abelian category \\(\\mathcal A\\). Before we actually do that, we need to introduce localization of categories, and we will define the derived category in terms of a localization of the homotopy category of complexes. Localization of categories is very analogous to localization of rings or modules. Given any category (with no assumption of abelian, additive, triangulated, etc), we formally invert a class of morphisms. We will give one definition in terms of a localization construction and show that it is unsatisfactory in that it does not have a lot of useful and desirable properties. We will then develop a better description of derived categories in terms of roofs. Definition 1. Let \\(\\mathcal A\\) be a category and \\(S\\) a class of morphisms of it, then define its localization as a category \\(\\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\\) and a functor \\(Q:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow A[S^{-1}]\\) s.t. \\(Q(s)\\) is an isomorphism for all \\(s\\in S\\) and \\(Q\\) is universal w.r.t. this property, i.e. if the functor \\(F:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow\\mathcal B\\) is such that \\(F(s)\\) is an isomorphism for each \\(s\\), then there exists a unique functor \\(G:\\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\\rightarrow\\mathcal B\\) s.t. \\(F=G\\circ Q\\). The way we obtain a construction that satisfies this universal property is quite convoluted. We define it this way. Let \\(\\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\\) have the same objects as \\(\\mathcal A\\). For each \\(X,Y\\in\\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\\), let a directed edge between them be a morphism \\(f\\in\\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\\) or if \\(s\\in S\\cap \\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)\\), an edge in the opposite direction \\(s:Y\\rightarrow X\\). A path between two objects \\(M,N\\in A[S^{-1}]\\) is a sequence of directed edges \\(M=L_0, L_1,\\dots,L_n=N\\), where the direction does not need to be the same. We define \\(\\mathrm{Hom}(M,N)\\) as the equivalence class of paths where two paths are equivalent if they can be transformed to each other via a sequence of the following transformations. for \\(X\\xrightarrow{f}Y\\xrightarrow{g}Z\\), replace with \\(X\\xrightarrow{gf}Z\\), for \\(X\\xrightarrow{s} Y\\xleftarrow{s}X\\) where \\(s\\in S\\), replace with \\(X\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf{1}_X} X\\), for \\(Y\\xleftarrow{s} X\\xrightarrow{s}Y\\) where \\(s\\in S\\), replace with \\(Y\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf{1}_Y} Y\\), for \\(X\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf{1}_X}X\\xleftarrow{s} Y\\), replace with \\(X\\xleftarrow{s}Y\\) Long story short, this is a well defined equivalence relation, so it forms a category where composition is concatonation. For the localization functor \\(Q:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow \\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\\), it sends objects to themselves, and morphisms to the equivalence class with the path being the single morphism. Here we should give extra care that the arrows can some times mean directed edges, and is \\(Y\\leftarrow X\\) can mean a path from \\(Y\\) to \\(X\\), only with the directed edge in the opposite direction. We can verify that this indeed satisfies the universal property of localization. We may also check that by this localization construciton, one can write morphisms in the form \\[\\left(Q\\left(f_1\\right) \\circ Q\\left(s_1\\right)^{-1}\\right) \\circ \\cdots \\circ\\left(Q\\left(f_n\\right) \\circ Q\\left(s_n\\right)^{-1}\\right)\\] where \\(s_i\\in S\\). A localizing class \\(S\\) of a category \\(\\mathcal A\\) is a class of morphisms such that all identity morphisms are in \\(S\\). if two morphisms in \\(S\\) compose, then their composition in in \\(S\\). for any \\(f:M\\rightarrow N\\) and \\(s:L\\rightarrow N\\) with \\(s\\in S\\), exists \\(g:K\\rightarrow L\\) and \\(t:K\\rightarrow M\\) with \\(t\\in S\\) s.t. commutes. for any \\(f:N\\rightarrow M\\) and \\(s:N\\rightarrow L\\) with \\(s\\in S\\), exists \\(g:L\\rightarrow K\\) and \\(t:M\\rightarrow K\\) with \\(t\\in S\\) s.t. commutes. for any morphisms \\(f,g:M\\rightarrow N\\), we have \\(\\exists s\\in S, sf=sg \\Longleftrightarrow \\exists t\\in S, ft=gt\\) This is the categorification of the notion of denominator set when localizing non-commutative rings, see Ore condition. In fact a ring can be viewed as an additive category (by delooping). The localizing classes are classes of ‚Äúnice‚Äù morphisms to localize at for which we could develop a description of roofs. For a category \\(\\mathcal A\\) and a localizing class \\(S\\). A morphism \\(Q(f)\\circ Q(s)^{-1}\\) in \\(\\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\\) is represented by a left roof, which is a diagram \\(M\\xleftarrow{s}L\\xrightarrow{f}N\\), and a morphism \\(Q(t)^{-1}\\circ Q(g)\\) with \\(t\\in S\\) is represented by a right roof which is a diagram \\(M\\xrightarrow{g}L\\xleftarrow{t}N\\). We say that the two left roofs \\(M\\xleftarrow{s}L\\xrightarrow{f}N\\) and \\(M\\xleftarrow{t}K\\xrightarrow{g}N\\) are equivalent if there exists \\(p:H\\rightarrow L\\) and \\(q:H\\rightarrow K\\) such that \\(sp,tq\\in S\\) and the diagram commutes. We can show that this is an equivalence relation. The only difficult part is transitivity. This can be done using a diagram chasing argument. We can also define composition of roofs. The composition of the previous two roofs is defined as a composition of the diagram where \\(U\\) and the associated maps are induced from the fact that \\(S\\) is a localizing class. We could check that these satisfies all the desirable properties of a composition. Composition respects equivalence of roofs, is associative, and has an identity given by \\(M\\xleftarrow{\\mathbf{1}_M} M\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf{1}_M} M\\). One can check that the category of (equivalence classes of) left roofs \\(\\mathcal A_S\\) is equivalent to right roofs, so we might as well just work with left roofs. We define a functor \\(Q:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow \\mathcal A_S\\) by letting it be identity on objects and for each morphism \\(f:M\\rightarrow N\\), let \\(Q(f)\\) be the equivalence class of roofs \\(M\\xleftarrow{\\mathbf 1_M}M\\xrightarrow{f} N\\). This satisfies the universal property of localization, hence isomorphic to \\(\\mathcal A[S^{-1}]\\). Theorem 2. For \\(S\\) a localizing class of category \\(\\mathcal A\\), the category \\(\\mathcal A_S\\) and functor \\(Q:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow \\mathcal A_S\\) satisfies the universal property of localization, i.e. \\(Q(s)\\) is an isomorphism for each \\(s\\in S\\) and is universal w.r.t. it. Proof For the first property, \\(M\\xleftarrow{\\mathbf{1}_M}M\\xrightarrow{s}N\\) has an inverse \\(N\\xleftarrow{s}M\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf{1}_M}M\\). Next, suppose \\(F:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow \\mathcal B\\) is such that \\(F(s)\\) is an isomorphism for all \\(s\\in S\\), define functor \\(G:\\mathcal A_S\\rightarrow \\mathcal B\\) as identity on objects, and for morphisms, the following. If \\(\\phi:M\\rightarrow N\\) in \\(\\mathcal A_S\\), choose a representing roof \\(M\\xleftarrow{s}L\\xrightarrow{f}N\\), and define \\(G(\\phi)=F(f)\\circ F(s)^{-1}\\). It‚Äôs not immediately obvious that this is well defined on equivalence classes, but we omit the verification. This obviously satisfies \\(F=G\\circ Q\\). It is left to the reader to verify that \\(G\\) respects composition, which is the last piece of verification necessary. If \\(\\mathcal A\\) is an additive category, then localizing it would also have an additive structure. In fact if \\(\\mathcal A\\) is additive, we may restate the last axiom of localizing class as: for \\(f:M\\rightarrow N\\) exists \\(\\exists s\\in S, sf=0\\Longleftrightarrow \\exists t\\in S, tf=0\\). And the inherited additive structure is the obvious one. It is not trivial to check that it is well defined, but again we ommit the verification. Again everything works out as we expected, biproducts, zero objects are preserved, and localization functor is additive. We can also check that \\(f=0\\) in the localization iff exists \\(t\\in S\\) with \\(tf=0\\) iff exists \\(t\\in S\\) with \\(ft=0\\), and \\(M=\\mathbf 0\\) in the localization iff exists \\(N\\in\\mathcal A\\) with \\((N\\xrightarrow{0}M)\\in S\\) iff exists \\(N\\in\\mathcal A\\) with \\((M\\xrightarrow{0}N)\\in S\\). These are easy to prove and left as an exercise. Similarly, one can show the localization of abelian categories is abelian. Given a triangulated category, a natural question to ask is: when is a localization of it also triangulated? In other words, when is the localizing class compatible with triangulation? For a localizing class \\(S\\) in the triangulated category \\(\\mathcal C\\), the localization is compatible with triangulation if the following conditions hold for each morphism \\(f\\), we have \\(f\\in S\\) iff \\(f[1]\\) in \\(S\\). a diagram with \\(s,t\\in S\\) and distinguished rows can be completed to a morphism of distinguished triangles. We can show that if these conditions hold then the localization \\(\\mathcal C[S^{-1}]\\) inherits the triangulated structure \\(QT_{\\mathcal C}\\), and a triangle is distinguished if it is isomorphic to an image of a distinguished triangle. One can show that a cohomological functor on \\(\\mathcal C\\) induces a corresponding cohomological functor on \\(\\mathcal C[S^{-1}]\\). Definition 3. The derived category \\(D(\\mathcal A)\\) of an abelian categroy \\(\\mathcal A\\) is the localization \\(K(\\mathcal A)[S^{-1}]\\) where \\(S\\) is the class of quasi-isomorphisms. Let \\(D^{+}(\\mathcal A),D^{-}(\\mathcal A),D^{b}(\\mathcal A)\\) be the full subcategory of \\(D(\\mathcal A)\\) to the bounded below, bounded above, and bounded complexes. It is an arduous process to verify that the class of quasi-isomorphisms is a localizing class compatible with triangulation, which the readers can do in their own time. Theorem 4. For an abelian category \\(\\mathcal A\\), the functor \\(\\mathcal A\\rightarrow D(\\mathcal A)\\) by \\(X\\mapsto X\\) is fully faithful.

This will help us build towards the definition of derived categories. In some sense, triangulated categories are approximations of abelian categories. They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don‚Äôt really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories. Instead of kernels, cokernels, and strict morphisms, triangulated categories bypass these notions and start out with ‚Äúdistinguished triangles‚Äù, which are similar to exact sequences. A translation functor on an additive category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is an automorphism \\(T:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal C\\) where we denote \\(T^n(X)=X[n]\\) and \\(T^nf=f[n]\\) for \\(n\\in\\mathbb Z\\). A triangle is a diagram \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X[1]\\), and a morphism of triangles is a diagramwhich commutes. A triangulated category is an additive category \\(\\mathcal C\\) with a translation functor and a family of triangles called distinguished triangles such that the following axioms are satisfied. For any \\(X\\in\\mathcal C\\), the triangle \\(X\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf 1_X} X\\rightarrow \\mathbf 0\\rightarrow X[1]\\) is distinguished. Any triangle isomorphic to a distinguished triangle is distinguished. Any morphism \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\) can be completed to a distinguished triangle \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X[1]\\). (Rotation axiom) A triangle \\(X\\xrightarrow{u} Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X[1]\\) is distinguished iff \\(Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X[1]\\xrightarrow{-u[1]}Y[1]\\) is. Suppose the rows in the diagram are distinguished, and the left square commutes, then there exists a morphism \\(w:Z\\rightarrow Z^\\prime\\) (not necessarily unique) completing the diagram into a morphism of triangles. (Octahedral axiom) Suppose the first three rows are distinguished and the left two squares commute, then there exists morphisms \\(u,v,w\\) completing the diagram into two morphisms of triangles and the whole diagram commutes and the last row is also distinguished If all but the last axiom is satisfied, then it is known as a pre-triangulated category. It is conjectured that pre-triangulated categories are triangulated, i.e. the last axiom is redundant. The general concensus seems to be that this is not true. An additive functor between triangulated categories \\(F:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal D\\) is said to commute with translation if there is a natural isomorphism \\(FT_{\\mathcal C}\\cong T_{\\mathcal D} F\\), and \\(F\\) is said to be exact or triangulated if it commutes with translation and takes distinguished triangles to distinguished triangles. Let \\(F,G:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal D\\) be exact functors, and \\(\\eta_{F}:FT_{\\mathcal C}\\rightarrow T_{\\mathcal D}F\\) and \\(\\eta_{G}:GT_{\\mathcal C}\\rightarrow T_{\\mathcal D}G\\) be natural isomorphisms, then a natural transformation \\(w:F\\rightarrow G\\) is graded if for \\(X\\in\\mathcal C\\) commutes. Theorem 1. In a (pre)triangulated category \\(\\mathcal C\\), if \\(X\\xrightarrow{u} Y\\xrightarrow{v} Z\\xrightarrow{w} X[1]\\) is distinguished, then \\(vu=0\\) and \\(wv=0\\) any change of sign of exactly two of \\(u,v,w\\) is distinguished, if \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\), then there exists long exact sequences of abelian groups \\[\\begin{aligned}&amp;\\cdots\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Hom}(U,X[i])\\xrightarrow{u[i]_*}\\mathrm{Hom}(U,Y[i])\\xrightarrow{v[i]_*} \\mathrm{Hom}(U,Z[i])\\xrightarrow{w[i]_*}\\mathrm{Hom}(U,X[i+1])\\rightarrow\\cdots\\\\ &amp;\\cdots\\leftarrow\\mathrm{Hom}(X[i],U)\\xleftarrow{u[i]^*}\\mathrm{Hom}(Y[i],U)\\xleftarrow{v[i]^*} \\mathrm{Hom}(Z[i],U)\\xleftarrow{w[i]^*}\\mathrm{Hom}(X[i+1],U)\\leftarrow\\cdots\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(f^*,f_*\\) for some \\(f\\) represents maps induced by Hom-functors. (triangulated 5-lemma) Consider a morphism of distinguished triangles, and let its components be \\(f:X\\rightarrow X^\\prime,g:Y\\rightarrow Y^\\prime,h:Z\\rightarrow Z^\\prime\\), then if any two of them are isomorphisms, so is the third. \\(u\\) is an isomorphism iff \\(Z\\cong\\mathbf{0}\\) Proof It suffice to show \\(vu=0\\), and \\(wv=0\\) can be obtained from the rotation axiom. To show this, we first note that \\(Z\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow \\mathbf 0\\rightarrow Z[1]\\) is distinguished. The triangle \\(Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X[1]\\rightarrow Y[1]\\) is distinguished by axiom 4, and we construct a morphism between them via axiom 5, and then we can obtain \\(vu=0\\) from the commutativity of a square in the diagram. Straightforwardly, the triangle obtained by changing exactly two signs is isomorphic to the original triangle by an obvious morphism of triangles, so it is still distinguished. We will only prove the first one, and the second one is proved dually. Since \\(vu=0\\), we have \\((v[i])(u[i])=0\\), so \\(\\mathrm{Im}(u[i]_*)\\subseteq \\mathrm{Ker}(v[i]_*)\\). Conversely, suppose \\(f\\in \\mathrm{Ker}(v[i]_*)\\), so \\(f(v[i])=0\\). Consider the diagram as follows\\[\\require{AMScd}\\begin{CD}U[-i] @&gt;{}&gt;&gt; \\mathbf{0} @&gt;{}&gt;&gt; U[-i+1] @&gt;{-\\mathbf{1}}&gt;&gt; U[-i+1]\\\\@VV{f[-i]}V @VVV @. @VV{f[-i+1]}V \\\\Y @&gt;{v}&gt;&gt; Z @&gt;{w}&gt;&gt; X[1] @&gt;{-u[1]}&gt;&gt; Y[1]\\end{CD}\\] which we can complete to a morphism of triangles with some \\(h:U[-i+1]\\rightarrow X[1]\\). By the commutativity of the rightmost square, \\(-f[-i+1]=-(u[i])h\\) so \\(f=(u[i])(h[-i+1])\\), so \\(f\\in \\mathrm{Im}(u[i]_*)\\). By the rotation axiom, since we proved a short exact sequence, we have the exactness of the long exact sequence. By the rotation axiom, it suffice to show the case where the first two are isomorphisms. By using (3), we have a long exact sequence, and we can obtain the isomorphism using the usual 5-lemma, details ommited. A striaghtforward corollary. Let \\(\\mathcal C\\) be a triangulated category and \\(\\mathcal A\\) an abelian category, then an additive functor \\(H:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal A\\) is called cohomological if for every distinguished triangle \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X[1]\\), the sequence \\(H(X)\\rightarrow H(Y)\\rightarrow H(Z)\\) is exact. It is then a straightforward consequence by the rotation axiom that for every distinguished triangle \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow X[1]\\), we have the following long exact sequence\\[\\cdots\\rightarrow H(X[i])\\xrightarrow{H(u[i])} H(Y[i])\\xrightarrow{H(v[i])}H(Z[i])\\xrightarrow{H(w[i])}H(X[i+1])\\rightarrow\\cdots\\] What we just proved in part 3 of the previous theorem is that the Hom-functor is cohomological. Definition 2. An object in an abelian category is simple if the only subobjects are zero and the object itself, and semisimple if it is a coproduct of simple objects. An abelian category is semisimple if every short exact sequence splits. Caution: some authors call a category semisimple if all objects are semisimple, which is a stronger definition and is NOT equivalent to our definition. Every semisimple abelian category has a triangulated structure. To do this, we let the translation functor be the identity functor, and we declare a triangle \\(X\\xrightarrow{u} Y\\xrightarrow{v} Z\\xrightarrow{w} X\\) distinguished if it is ‚Äúexact‚Äù at \\(X\\), i.e. \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(u)=\\mathrm{Im}(w)\\). Verifying this is a triangulated category is a tedious, and we will not do it here. Moreover, all abelian triangulated categories are semisimple. We will not prove this either. In fact, the homotopy category of complexes \\(K(\\mathcal A)\\) is triangulated. To see this, we set the distinguished triangles to be the ones isomorphic to a standard triangle of the form \\[X^\\bullet\\xrightarrow{f^\\bullet} Y^\\bullet \\xrightarrow{i_f^\\bullet} \\mathrm{Cone}(f^\\bullet)\\xrightarrow{p_f^\\bullet} X^\\bullet[1]\\] and as expected, the cohomology functor \\(H^n:K(\\mathcal A)\\rightarrow\\mathcal A\\) is cohomological.","link":"/archives/3e09458/"},{"title":"Bruhat order, Sperner property, and the fraction of an Sn-orbit on a hyperplane","text":"‚ÄúMathematics is the music of reason.‚Äù James J. Sylvester This week is the first week of the spring term and also my first week of undergraduate research with Prof. Satriano, so I decided to write about a research paper I‚Äôve given to read, this one. In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \\(\\sigma\\in S_n\\) acts on \\(v\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) by permutation, and let \\(\\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\\{\\sigma\\in S_n: w\\cdot \\sigma v=0\\}\\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \\(\\sum_ix_i=0\\), where \\(n\\ge 3\\). In notations, we have the following theorem. Theorem 1. For \\(n\\ge 3\\), we have\\[\\max\\{|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|: v\\in S,w\\in\\mathbf{R}^n\\}=2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor (n-2)!\\]where \\(S=\\{v\\in \\mathbf R^n: v\\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\ne 0, v\\mathrm{\\ has\\ distinct\\ coordinates}\\}\\). An explicit construction that achieves this bound is given by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, so it suffice to show that this is the best bound. The proof uses Bruhat order and Sperner property. Bruhat orderSuppose \\(\\alpha\\vdash n\\) with \\(\\ell(\\alpha)=m\\), and \\(i_j=\\sum_{k=1}^j\\alpha_j\\) for \\(j=0,1\\dots,m\\). Let \\(X_{\\alpha}\\) be the set of ordered set partitions of type \\(\\alpha\\). Naturally, we have \\(\\alpha^*\\in X_{\\alpha}\\) where \\(\\alpha^*_j=\\{i_j+1,i_j+2,\\dots,i_{j+1}\\}\\). Let \\(S(\\alpha)=\\{i_1,\\dots,i_{m-1}\\}\\). We have \\(S_n\\) acts on \\(X_{\\alpha}\\) by element, which is a transitive action. Thus identify \\(X_{\\alpha}\\cong S_n/S_\\alpha\\) where \\(S_{\\alpha}\\) is the stabilizer of \\(\\alpha^*\\). Denote \\(\\alpha!=|S_{\\alpha}|=\\prod_{i}\\alpha_i!\\) Definition 2. The Bruhat order on \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\) is the transitive closure (they are connected by relations of the following kind) of \\(B&lt;(i\\ j)B\\) for \\(B\\in S_n/S_\\alpha\\) where \\(i\\in B_a\\) and \\(j\\in B_b\\) and \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(i&lt;j\\). We note that the Bruhat order on \\(S_n/S_{(1,\\dots,1)}\\) is just the usual Bruhat order on \\(S_n\\). For \\(B\\in S_n/S_\\alpha\\) let \\(\\operatorname{word}(B)\\) be the permutation by concatonating the numbers in each set written in their usual order. This sends ordered set partitions to a more common definition: \\(\\sigma\\in S_n\\) where \\(\\sigma(i)&gt;\\sigma(i+1)\\) implies \\(i\\in S(\\alpha)\\), and Bruhat order restricted to such permutations. There is an obvious bijection \\((S_n/S_\\alpha)\\times S_\\alpha\\rightarrow S_n\\) by \\((B,\\sigma)\\mapsto \\operatorname{word}(B)\\sigma\\). The \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order \\(\\le_{\\alpha}\\) on \\(S_n\\) is the image of \\((B,\\sigma)\\le (B^\\prime,\\sigma^\\prime)\\) iff \\(\\sigma=\\sigma^\\prime\\) and \\(B\\le B^\\prime\\) in Bruhat order under the aforementioned bijection, which is isomorphic to \\(\\alpha!\\) isomorphic copies of \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\). If \\(w\\in\\mathbf R^n\\), define \\(\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\vdash n\\) as the composition of lengths of the weekly increasing components. An antichain in a poset is a set consisting of elements from different disjoint components. Lemma 3. Suppose \\(v\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) is stricly increasing and \\(w\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) weakly increasing, then \\(\\mathcal O(v,w)\\) is an antichain in the \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order where \\(\\alpha=\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\). Proof Suppose \\(\\pi\\in S_{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\tau=\\operatorname{word}(B)\\) for some \\(B\\in S_n/S_\\alpha\\). Suppose \\(i\\in B_a\\) and \\(j\\in B_b\\) for \\(i&lt;j\\) and \\(a&lt;b\\). We have \\(\\tau \\pi&lt; (i\\ j)\\tau \\pi\\). Next, we compute that\\[w\\cdot \\tau\\pi v-w\\cdot (i\\ j)\\tau \\pi v=(w_j-w_i)(v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(j)}-v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(i)})\\]Since \\(\\tau^{-1}(i)\\) is at a lower interval than \\(\\tau^{-1}(j)\\) (since \\(a&lt;b\\)) and \\(\\pi^{-1}\\) preserves these intervals, we have \\(v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(j)}&gt;v_{\\pi^{-1}\\tau^{-1}(i)}\\). Since we have \\(w_i&lt;w_j\\) by assumption, we have \\(w\\cdot \\tau\\pi v&gt;w\\cdot (i\\ j)\\tau \\pi v\\). Therefore, if \\(\\sigma&lt;_{\\alpha}\\sigma^\\prime\\) then \\(w\\cdot \\sigma v&gt;w\\cdot \\sigma^\\prime v\\). Therefore, we can bound the sizes of antichains in the \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order. Sperner propertyWe use \\(q\\)-polynomials to bound the sizes of antichains. Specifically, we will make use of the Sperner property of \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\): it is a ranked poset where the set of elements of rank \\(r\\), for some fixed \\(r\\), forms an antichain of maximal size. The rank generating function of \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\) is the \\(q\\)-binomial coefficient \\(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\). Theorem 4. Let \\(v,w\\in\\mathbf R^n\\) where \\(v\\) has distinct coordinates, then\\[|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|\\le \\alpha!M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\]where \\(\\alpha=\\operatorname{comp}(w)\\) and \\(M:\\mathbf{Z}[q]\\rightarrow\\mathbf Z\\) is the map that takes the maximum coefficient. Proof Since \\(|\\mathcal{O}(v,w)|=|\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma v,\\tau w)|\\) for any \\(\\sigma,\\tau\\in S^n\\), we can assume \\(v\\) is strictly increasing and \\(w\\) weakly increasing. By the previous lemma, we have \\(\\mathcal{O}(v,w)\\) is an antichain in the \\(\\alpha\\)-Bruhat order on \\(S_n\\), and hence also on \\(S_n/S_\\alpha\\times S_\\alpha\\). By the Sperner property, we have this bound. Therefore, it suffice to bound the coefficients of \\(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\). Bounding coefficientsGiven \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\vdash n\\), then we say \\(\\beta\\) refines \\(\\alpha\\), written as \\(\\alpha\\prec \\beta\\), if \\(\\beta\\) is obtained from \\(\\alpha\\) by decomposing its entries. Lemma 5. If \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\vdash n\\) and \\(\\alpha\\prec \\beta\\), then \\(\\beta !M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\beta\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\le \\alpha! M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ \\alpha\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\).

Eventually, with some lengthy calculations, we have \\(M\\left(\\begin{bmatrix}n\\\\ k\\end{bmatrix}_q\\right)\\le \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n}\\binom{n}{k}\\) for \\(n\\ge 0\\) and \\(2 &lt; k &lt; n-2\\).

In particular, I read from the wikipedia page on homological mirror symmetry that the derived category of coherent sheaves is a popular research topic in algebraic geometry. Also, I‚Äôve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don‚Äôt understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \\(K(\\mathcal A)\\). Definition 1. An additive category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a category where for each \\(A,B\\in\\mathcal C\\), the morphisms \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(A,B)\\) carry an additional additive abelian group structure, and satisfies \\(\\mathcal C\\) admits zero object, \\(\\mathcal C\\) admits finite products and finite coproducts which coincide, and addition is distributive, i.e. \\(g\\circ (f_1+f_2)=g\\circ f_1+g\\circ f_2\\) and \\((f_1+f_2)\\circ g=f_1\\circ g+ f_2\\circ g\\) We use the notation \\(\\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\\) for \\(\\mathrm{Mor}(A,B)\\) in additive categories to emphasize that the morphisms have an abelian group structure. An additive functor \\(\\mathcal F:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathcal D\\) between additive categories is a functor such that the associated map \\(\\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathcal F(A),\\mathcal F(B))\\) is a group homomorphism for each \\(A,B\\in\\mathcal C\\). Moreover, we denote by \\(0_{A,B}\\) (or \\(0\\) if there is no confusion) the identity element of \\(\\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\\). Note \\(0_{A,B}\\) is the zero morphism since it‚Äôs the unique morphism \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) which factors through \\(\\mathbf 0\\), i.e. \\(A\\rightarrow\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow B\\). In particular, note that \\(0_{A,B}\\circ f=0_{X,A}\\) and \\(g\\circ 0_{A,B}=0_{B,X}\\) for any \\(f:X\\rightarrow A\\) and \\(g:B\\rightarrow X\\), for any object \\(X\\). We note that equivalently, an additive functor maybe defined as a functor that preserves all finite biproducts. We recall that in a category \\(\\mathcal C\\), the equalizer \\(\\mathrm{Eq}(f,g)\\) of morphisms \\(f,g:A\\rightarrow B\\) is an object \\(E\\in\\mathcal C\\) and a morphism \\(e:E\\rightarrow A\\) s.t. the diagram \\(E\\rightarrow A\\rightrightarrows B\\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. Dually, the coequalizer \\(\\mathrm{Coeq}(f,g)\\) is an object \\(Q\\in\\mathcal C\\) and a morphism \\(q:B\\rightarrow Q\\) s.t. the diagram \\( A\\rightrightarrows B\\rightarrow Q\\) commutes and is universal with respect to this construction. In an additive category, for a morphism \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\), define its kernel \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(f)=\\mathrm{Eq}(f,0_{A,B})\\), cokernel \\(\\mathrm{Coker}(f)=\\mathrm{Coeq}(f,0_{A,B})\\). Spelled out explicitly, a kernel of \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) is an object \\(K\\) and a morphism \\(k:K\\rightarrow A\\) such that \\(f\\circ k=0_{K,B}\\), and given any \\(K^\\prime\\) and \\(k^\\prime:K^\\prime\\rightarrow A\\) with \\(f\\circ k^\\prime=0_{K^\\prime,B}\\), there exists unique \\(u:K^\\prime\\rightarrow K\\) s.t. \\(k\\circ u=k^\\prime\\). Dually, a cokernel of \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) is an object \\(Q\\) with a morphism \\(q:B\\rightarrow Q\\) with \\(q\\circ f=0_{A,Q}\\), such that for any object \\(Q^\\prime\\) and morphism \\(q^\\prime:B\\rightarrow Q\\) with \\(q^\\prime\\circ f=0_{A,Q^\\prime}\\), there exists unique \\(u:Q\\rightarrow Q^\\prime\\) such that \\(q^\\prime=u\\circ q\\). Recall a subobject of an object \\(X\\) is an object \\(A\\) with a monomorphism \\(A\\hookrightarrow X\\), and a quotient object of \\(X\\) is an object \\(Q\\) with an epimorphism \\(X\\twoheadrightarrow Q\\). We remark that \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(f)\\) is a subobject of \\(A\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Coker}(f)\\) is a quotient object of \\(B\\), when they exist (it is an easy exercise to show equalizers are monic and coequalizers are epic). Definition 2. An abelian category is an additive category where every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel, every monomorphism is the kernel of its cokernel, and every epimorphism is the cokernel of its kernel. Moreover, in an abelian category, for any morphism \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\), we define its image as the kernel of its cokernel \\(\\mathrm{Im}(f)=\\mathrm{Ker}(\\mathrm{Coker}(f))\\), and coimage as the cokernel of its kernel \\(\\mathrm{Coim}(f)=\\mathrm{Coker}(\\mathrm{Ker}(f))\\). A quintessential example of an abelian category is the category of \\(R\\)-modules. In fact, the Freyd‚ÄìMitchell embedding theorem states that any abelian category can be embedded to the category of \\(R\\)-modules for some \\(R\\) via a fully faithful functor. So we may use element-wise diagram chasing in abelian categories, which may help us derive diagram chasing theorems such as \\(5\\)-lemma and snake lemma. In an abelian category, all finite limits and colimits exist, in particular, pullbacks exist and they preserve monomorphisms and epimorphisms. Lemma 3. In an abelian category, a morphism \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) is monic iff \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(f)=\\mathbf 0\\), and epic iff \\(\\mathrm{Coker}(f)=\\mathbf 0\\), a morphism \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) is an isomorphism iff it is monic and epic, each morphism \\(f:X\\rightarrow Y\\) factorizes canonically as \\(X\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Im}(f)\\hookrightarrow Y\\) and \\(X\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow Y\\) for a morphism \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\), if it factorizes as \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow X\\rightarrow B\\) then \\(\\mathrm{Coker}(f)=\\mathrm{Coker}(X\\rightarrow B)\\), and if it factorizes as \\(A\\rightarrow X\\hookrightarrow B\\), then \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(f)=\\mathrm{Ker}(A\\rightarrow X)\\). Proof Left as an exercise. Left as an exercise. We will only prove the factorization \\(X\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow Y\\), and the other one can be proved dually. First, we have \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(f)\\hookrightarrow X\\rightarrow Y\\) is zero and \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(f)\\hookrightarrow X\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\) is zero, so we have a factorization \\(X\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\rightarrow Y\\) by the universal property of cokernels. It remains to show that \\(\\beta:\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\rightarrow Y\\) is a monomorphism. Suppose \\(\\varphi_1,\\varphi_2:Z\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\) with \\(\\beta\\circ \\varphi_1=\\beta\\circ \\varphi_2\\), therefore \\(\\beta\\circ \\sigma=0\\) where \\(\\sigma=\\varphi_1-\\varphi_2\\). Consider the pullback \\(W=X\\times_{\\mathrm{Coim}(f)}Z\\) with \\(\\tau:W\\rightarrow Z\\) and \\(\\pi:W\\rightarrow X\\) of the maps \\(\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). We note that \\(f\\circ\\pi=\\beta\\circ\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\circ \\pi=\\beta\\circ\\sigma\\circ\\tau=0\\), so \\(\\pi\\) factors through \\(\\mathrm{Ker}(f)\\) by \\(W\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ker}(f)\\hookrightarrow X\\) say \\(w:W\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ker}(f)\\). Therefore, \\(\\sigma\\circ\\tau=\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\circ \\mathrm{Ker}(f)\\circ w=0\\circ w=0\\). Since pullbacks preserve epimorphisms, \\(\\tau\\) is epic. Thus \\(\\sigma\\circ\\tau=0\\) implies \\(\\sigma=0\\), so \\(\\varphi_1=\\varphi_2\\). Left as an exercise. For a morphism \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) in an abelian category, we factor \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) canonically as \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\), and since \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Coker}(f)\\) is zero and \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\) is epic, \\(\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Coker}(f)\\) is zero, so we can factor \\(\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\) as \\(\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Im}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\). We denote by \\(\\overline{f}:\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Im}(f)\\) the map induced by this factorization, and say \\(f\\) is strict if \\(\\overline{f}\\) is an isomorphism. Theorem 4. (First isomorphism theorem) In an abelian category, all morphisms are strict. Proof Suppose \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) is a morphism in an abelian category, and factorize as \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\). By Lemma 3, \\(\\mathrm{Coker}(f)=\\mathrm{Coker}(\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow B)\\). Since \\(\\mathrm{Coim}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\) is monic, it is the kernel of its cokernel, so it is the kernel of \\(\\mathrm{Coker}(f)\\). Since \\(\\mathrm{Im}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\) in our construction is also the kernel of \\(\\mathrm{Coker}(f)\\), the induced map \\(\\overline{f}\\) is an isomorphism by the universal property of kernels. In an abelian category, suppose \\(f:A\\rightarrow B\\) and \\(g:B\\rightarrow C\\) are such that \\(g\\circ f=0\\). We factor \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Im}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\), and since \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{Im}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\rightarrow C\\) is zero and \\(A\\twoheadrightarrow\\mathrm{Im}(f)\\) is epic, we have \\(\\mathrm{Im}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\rightarrow C\\) is zero. Thus, we can factor \\(\\mathrm{Im}(f)\\hookrightarrow B\\) as \\(\\mathrm{Im}(f)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ker}(g)\\hookrightarrow B\\), and the map \\(\\mathrm{Im}(f)\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ker}(g)\\) is the canonical map. We say such sequence \\(A\\rightarrow B\\rightarrow C\\) is exact if the canonical map is an isomorphism. More generally, a sequence \\(d_A^i:A^i\\rightarrow A^{i+1}\\)\\[\\cdots\\longrightarrow A^{i-1}\\xrightarrow{\\ d^{i-1}_A\\ } A^i\\xrightarrow{\\ \\ d^{i}_A\\ \\ } A^{i+1}\\longrightarrow\\cdots\\]is called a (co)chain complex if each three term subsequence compose to zero, and exact or acyclic if each three term subsequence is exact. A chain map \\(f^\\bullet:A^\\bullet\\rightarrow B^\\bullet\\) is a commutative diagram A chain homotopy is a collection of maps $h^i:A^i\\rightarrow B^{i-1}$ s.t. $f^i-g^i=d^{i-1}_B\\circ h^i+h^{i+1}\\circ d^i_A$ for all $i$, illustrated by which typically does NOT commute. We write \\(f^\\bullet\\simeq g^\\bullet\\) if they are chain homotopic, and we say \\(A^\\bullet\\) and \\(B^\\bullet\\) are chain homotopy equivalent if there are chain maps \\(f^\\bullet:A\\rightarrow B\\) and \\(g^\\bullet:B\\rightarrow A\\) s.t. \\(f^\\bullet\\circ g^\\bullet \\simeq \\mathbf{1}_{B^\\bullet}\\) and \\(g^\\bullet\\circ f^\\bullet \\simeq \\mathbf{1}_{A^\\bullet}\\), in which case \\(f^\\bullet\\) are \\(g^\\bullet\\) called homotopy pseudo-inverses. If \\(A\\) is a category, let \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\) be the category of chain complexes in \\(\\mathcal A\\) with chain maps are morphisms. If \\(\\mathcal A\\) is additive, then \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\) inherits an obvious group structure on its morphisms, and they make it an additive category as well. Also, if \\(\\mathcal A\\) is abelian then so is \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\). Let \\(C^+(\\mathcal A)\\) be the full subcategory of \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\) where the complexes are bounded below (exists \\(N\\in\\mathbb Z\\) s.t. \\(A^i=\\mathbb 0\\) for \\(i &lt; N \\)), and similarly \\(C^-(\\mathcal A)\\) is the full subcategory \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\) where the complexes are bounded above. Let \\(C^b(\\mathcal A)\\) be the full subcategory of \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\) where the complexes are bounded below and above. Definition 5. Let \\(A^\\bullet\\) be a cochain complex in \\(\\mathcal A\\) with canonical morphisms \\(\\mathrm{Im}(d^{n-1})\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Ker}(d^{n})\\), define\\[H^n(A^\\bullet)=\\mathrm{Coker}(\\mathrm{Im}(d^{n-1})\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Ker}(d^{n}))\\]as the \\(n\\)-th cohomology object. In fact, for a chain map \\(f^\\bullet: A^\\bullet\\rightarrow B^\\bullet\\), we associate an induced morphism \\(H^nf^\\bullet:H^n(A^\\bullet)\\rightarrow H^n(B^\\bullet)\\), which makes \\(H^n\\) an additive functor \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\rightarrow\\mathcal A\\). Moreover, \\(f^\\bullet\\) is said to be a quasi-isomorphism if \\(H^nf^\\bullet\\) is an isomorphism for all \\(n\\in\\mathbb Z\\). Let \\(\\mathcal A\\) be an abelian category. The translation functor \\(T:C(\\mathcal A)\\rightarrow C(\\mathcal A)\\) sends a complex \\(A^\\bullet =(A^i,d^i)\\) to the complex \\(T(A^\\bullet) =(A^{i+1},-d^{i+1})\\), and \\(T(f^\\bullet):T(A^\\bullet)\\rightarrow T(B^\\bullet)\\) for \\(f^\\bullet:A^\\bullet\\rightarrow B^\\bullet\\) is given by \\(T(f^\\bullet)^i=f^{i+1}\\). The functor essentially shifts the complex left by one, where the negative sign of the differential is a convention useful later. We denote by \\(A^\\bullet[n]=T^n(A^\\bullet)\\) for \\(n\\in\\mathbb Z\\) (negative integers correspond to right translations). The right truncation functor \\(\\tau_{\\le n}:C(\\mathcal A)\\rightarrow C^-(\\mathcal A)\\) sends a complex in the following way where the red arrow is induced via universal property. The functor \\(\\tau_{\\le n}:C(\\mathcal A)\\rightarrow \\mathcal A\\) sends the morphisms in the obvious way. Moreover, we have a canonical monomorphism \\(\\tau_{\\le n}(A^\\bullet)\\rightarrow A^\\bullet\\) which induces isomorphisms on their cohomology objects. The left truncation functor \\(\\tau_{\\ge n}:C(\\mathcal A)\\rightarrow C^+(\\mathcal A)\\) is defined dually. Definition 6. Suppose \\(f^\\bullet:A^\\bullet\\rightarrow B^\\bullet\\) is a morphism in \\(C(\\mathcal A)\\) for some abelian category \\(\\mathcal A\\). The cone of \\(f^\\bullet\\) is \\(\\mathrm{Cone}(f^\\bullet)=A^\\bullet[1]\\oplus B^\\bullet\\). Spelled out explicitly, the cochain complex consists of objects \\(A^{n+1}\\oplus B^n\\), and the differential \\(d^n:A^{n+1}\\oplus B^n\\rightarrow A^{n+2}\\oplus B^{n+1}\\) is given by\\[d^n=\\begin{pmatrix}-d_{A^\\bullet}^{n+1}&amp;0\\\\ f^{n+1}&amp; d_{B^\\bullet}^n\\end{pmatrix}\\]acting as though on column vectors. We remark that a short exact sequence of complexes induces a long exact sequence of cohomology. Say we have\\[\\mathbf 0\\longrightarrow A^{\\bullet}\\xrightarrow{\\ f^{\\bullet}\\ } B^\\bullet\\xrightarrow{\\ g^\\bullet\\ } C^\\bullet\\longrightarrow\\mathbf 0\\]a short exact sequence of complexes, then for each \\(n\\), exists \\(\\delta^n:H^n(C^\\bullet)\\rightarrow H^{n+1}(A^\\bullet)\\) making\\[\\cdots\\rightarrow H^n(A^\\bullet)\\rightarrow H^n(B^\\bullet)\\rightarrow H^n(C^\\bullet)\\xrightarrow{\\delta^n} H^{n+1}(A^\\bullet)\\rightarrow H^{n+1}(B^\\bullet)\\rightarrow H^{n+1}(C^\\bullet)\\rightarrow\\cdots\\]exact. This is a very common construction in homological algebra, and the way we construct these connecting morphisms is by applying the snake lemma twice. Suppose \\(f^\\bullet:A^\\bullet\\rightarrow B^\\bullet\\) is a chain map with cone \\(C^\\bullet=\\mathrm{Cone}(f^\\bullet)\\), then the map \\(\\iota^{n}=0 \\oplus \\operatorname{Id}_{B^{n}}: B^{n} \\rightarrow C^{n}\\) and the canonical projection \\(\\rho^n:C^n\\rightarrow A^{n+1}\\) gives chain maps \\(\\iota^\\bullet:B^\\bullet\\rightarrow C^\\bullet\\) and \\(\\rho^\\bullet:C^\\bullet \\rightarrow A^\\bullet [1]\\) which fits into a short exact sequence \\[\\mathbf 0\\longrightarrow B^{\\bullet}\\xrightarrow{\\ \\iota^{\\bullet}\\ } C^\\bullet\\xrightarrow{\\ \\rho^\\bullet\\ } A^\\bullet[1]\\longrightarrow\\mathbf 0\\]Hence this induces a long exact sequence on cohomology objects. Working out the connecting morphism, we find out that the connecting morphisms are nothing more than the induced morphisms \\(\\delta^n=H^{n+1}f^\\bullet\\). From this fact, we deduce that \\(f^\\bullet\\) is a quasi-isomorphism iff the cone \\(\\mathrm{Cone}(f^\\bullet)\\) is acyclic. Definition 7. Suppose \\(\\mathcal A\\) is an abelian category. An object \\(X\\) in \\(\\mathcal A\\) is injective (resp. projective) if the contravariant (resp. covariant) left exact (resp. right exact) hom-functor \\(\\mathrm{Hom}(-,X):\\mathcal A\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Ab}\\) (resp. \\(\\mathrm{Hom}(X,-):\\mathcal A\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Ab}\\)) is exact. Moreover, we say \\(\\mathcal A\\) has enough injectives (resp. enough projectives) if for any object \\(Y\\) there is an injective object (resp. projective object) \\(X\\) and a monomorphism \\(Y\\rightarrow X\\) (resp. epimorphism \\(X\\rightarrow Y\\)). An injective resolution of an object \\(X\\) is a complex \\(I^\\bullet\\) bounded below \\(0\\) and a quasi-isomorphism \\(X\\rightarrow I^\\bullet\\), or equivalently, an exact sequence\\[\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow I^0\\rightarrow I^1\\rightarrow \\cdots\\]where each \\(I^i\\) is injective. Dually, a projective resolution of an object \\(X\\) is a complex \\(P_\\bullet\\) bounded above \\(0\\) and a quasi-isomorphism \\(P_\\bullet\\rightarrow X\\), or equivalently, an exact sequence\\[\\cdots\\rightarrow P_1\\rightarrow P_0\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow \\mathbf 0\\]where each \\(P_i\\) is projective. It is a familiar result in homological algebra that if an abelian category has enough injectives (resp. enough projectives) then every object has an injective resolution (resp. projective resolution). Moreover, given a long exact sequence \\(\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow M^\\bullet\\) and an injective resolution of \\(I^\\bullet\\) of \\(Y\\), then every \\(f:X\\rightarrow Y\\) extends to a chain map and two such construction of chain maps are homotopic. The dual can be said about projective resolutions. I should also mention the Horseshoe lemma or the simultaneous resolution theorem, which states that if we have a short exact sequence \\(\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow X\\rightarrow Y\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow\\mathbf 0\\) and injective resolutions \\(I^\\bullet\\) for \\(Y\\) and \\(K^\\bullet\\) for \\(Z\\), then there is an injective resolution \\(J^\\bullet\\) of \\(Y\\) that and a short exact sequence of complexes \\(\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow I^\\bullet\\rightarrow J^\\bullet \\rightarrow K^\\bullet\\rightarrow\\mathbf 0\\) which splits. This does NOT commute. This implies that additive functors take split exact sequences to split exact sequences.Suppose \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow\\mathcal B\\) is a left exact functor betweeen abelian categories, then applying \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) to a short exact sequence \\(\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow A\\rightarrow B\\rightarrow C\\) gives a short exact sequence \\(\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow \\mathscr{F}(A)\\rightarrow \\mathscr{F}(B)\\rightarrow \\mathscr{F}(C)\\). A natural question to ask is whether we could continue this exact sequence to the right. It turns out that there is a canonical way of doing so, by defining the right derived functors \\(R^i\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow \\mathcal B\\), we may continue the exact sequence\\[\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow \\mathscr{F}(A)\\rightarrow\\mathscr{F}(B)\\rightarrow\\mathscr{F}(C)\\rightarrow R^1\\mathscr{F}(A)\\rightarrow R^1\\mathscr{F}(B)\\rightarrow R^1\\mathscr{F}(C)\\rightarrow\\cdots\\]Note that \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) is exact iff \\(R^1\\mathscr{F}=0\\), so in a sense the right derived functors measures how far \\(\\mathscr{F}\\) is from exact. Definition 8. Let \\(\\mathcal A,\\mathcal B\\) be abelian categories and \\(\\mathcal A\\) has enough injectives. Suppose \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal A\\rightarrow\\mathcal B\\) is a left-exact functor. Let \\(X\\in\\mathcal A\\) and suppose \\(I^\\bullet\\) is an injective resolution, then we obtain a complex\\[\\mathbf 0\\rightarrow \\mathscr{F}(I^0)\\rightarrow\\mathscr{F}(I^1)\\rightarrow\\mathscr{F}(I^2)\\rightarrow\\cdots\\]Define the right derived functors as the additive functors \\(R^i\\mathscr{F};\\mathcal A\\rightarrow\\mathcal B\\)\\[R^i\\mathscr{F}(X)=H^i(\\mathscr{F}I^\\bullet)\\]for \\(i\\ge 0\\). Left derived functors \\(L_i\\mathscr{F}\\) are defined dually via projective resolution. The most important examples of derived functors are the Ext and Tor functors. The Ext functor is the right derived functor of the hom-functor, and the Tor functor is the left derived functor of tensor product. Recall that there is a tensor-Hom adjunction \\(\\mathrm{Hom}(Y\\otimes X,Z)\\cong \\mathrm{Hom}(Y,\\mathrm{Hom}(X,Z))\\), so these functors are related very closely. Definition 9. For \\(A,B\\in \\mathbf{Mod}_R\\), define the Ext functors\\[\\begin{aligned}\\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(A,B)&amp;=(R^i\\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,-))(B)\\\\ &amp;\\cong (R^i\\mathrm{Hom}_R(-,B))(A)\\end{aligned} \\] and the Tor functors \\[\\begin{aligned}\\mathrm{Tor}_i^R(A,B)&amp;= (L_i(A\\otimes_R -))(B)\\\\ &amp;\\cong (L_i(-\\otimes_R B))(A)\\end{aligned}\\] for all \\(i\\ge 0\\). Example 10. Derived functors can help us defined many (co)homology theory. Sheaf cohomology. Let \\(X\\) be a topological space, then the global section functor \\(\\Gamma:\\mathrm{Sh}(X)\\rightarrow \\mathbf{Ab}\\) which sends \\(\\mathscr{F} \\mapsto \\mathscr{F}(X)\\) is left exact, its right derived functor \\(H^i(X,-):\\mathrm{Sh}(X)\\rightarrow \\mathbf{Ab}\\) is the sheaf cohomology \\(H^i(X,\\mathscr{F})\\). Its special cases include the de Rham cohomology. Group cohomology. Let \\(k\\) be an algebraically closed field and \\(G\\) a group, then the invariant functor \\((-)^G:\\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\\), which is the same as \\(\\mathrm{Hom}_{k[G]}(k,-)\\), is left exact, its right derived functor \\(H^i(G;-):\\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Mod}_{k[G]}\\) gives the group cohomology \\(H^i(G;M)=\\mathrm{Ext}^i_{k[G]}(k,M)\\). Hochschild cohomology. This one I‚Äôm not really familiar, so I will not write about it in detail. The derived functors are natural in the sense that if we have a morphism of two short exact sequence in \\(\\mathcal A\\), then the induced morphisms of the long exact sequences in \\(\\mathcal B\\) commutes with the long exact sequences. Finally, I‚Äôd like to finish with the definition of the homotopy category of complexes. We say that a chain map is nullhomotopic if it is homotopic to the zero chain. Definition 11. Let \\(\\mathcal A\\) be an abelian category, the homotopy category of complexes \\( K(\\mathcal A)\\) is the category where objects are (co)chain complexes in \\(\\mathcal A\\) and morphisms are chain maps up to homotopy, i.e. \\[\\mathrm{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(A^\\bullet,B^\\bullet)=\\mathrm{Hom}_{C(\\mathcal A)}(A^\\bullet,B^\\bullet)/G\\] where \\(G\\) is the subgroup of nullhomotopic chain maps. There are many things that needs to be checked here for it to be well defined, which we omit. We will see that this category is not typically abelian, but it is triangulated. A triangulated category is an approximation of an abelian category.","link":"/archives/4bee11dc/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Category Theory","slug":"Category-Theory","link":"/tags/Category-Theory/"},{"name":"Number Theory","slug":"Number-Theory","link":"/tags/Number-Theory/"},{"name":"Algebraic Geometry","slug":"Algebraic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Algebraic-Geometry/"},{"name":"Combinatorics","slug":"Combinatorics","link":"/tags/Combinatorics/"},{"name":"Algebraic geometry","slug":"Algebraic-geometry","link":"/tags/Algebraic-geometry/"},{"name":"Representation Theory","slug":"Representation-Theory","link":"/tags/Representation-Theory/"},{"name":"Differential Geometry","slug":"Differential-Geometry","link":"/tags/Differential-Geometry/"},{"name":"Logic Theory","slug":"Logic-Theory","link":"/tags/Logic-Theory/"},{"name":"Arithmetic Geometry","slug":"Arithmetic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Arithmetic-Geometry/"},{"name":"Lie Groups and Lie Algebras","slug":"Lie-Groups-and-Lie-Algebras","link":"/tags/Lie-Groups-and-Lie-Algebras/"},{"name":"Euclidean Geometry","slug":"Euclidean-Geometry","link":"/tags/Euclidean-Geometry/"},{"name":"Category theory","slug":"Category-theory","link":"/tags/Category-theory/"}],"categories":[{"name":"This Week I Learned","slug":"This-Week-I-Learned","link":"/categories/This-Week-I-Learned/"},{"name":"articles","slug":"articles","link":"/categories/articles/"},{"name":"Articles","slug":"Articles","link":"/categories/Articles/"}]}
