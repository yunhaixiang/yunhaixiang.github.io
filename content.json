My project is called “Galois cohomology and weak Mordell–Weil theorem”, which is available here. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \\(k\\) with an algebraic closure \\(K\\), the Galois group \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit of topological Galois groups \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \\(L/k\\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \\(G\\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \\(G\\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \\(G\\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation. My final project focuses on the proof of the weak Mordell–Weil theorem, which states that for any elliptic curve \\(E\\), the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is finite for all \\(n\\ge 2\\). This is an important step in the proof of the Mordell–Weil theorem which states the elliptic curve groups are finitely generated. The proof of Mordell–Weil involves in applying an infinite descent argument to weak Mordell–Weil, which I will not go into detail. The motivating observation is that we have an exact sequence of topological \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\)-modules \\[\\mathbf{0}\\rightarrow E(K)[n]\\rightarrow E(K)\\xrightarrow{n}E(K)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{0}\\]This short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which we truncate after the first cohomology groups. The first cohomology group can be viewed as the group of crossed homomorphisms module the principal crossed homomorphisms, where a crossed homomorphism is some \\(f\\) with \\(f(gh)=gf(h)+f(g)\\) for all \\(g,h\\) and a principal crossed homomorphism is a homomorphism where there exists \\(m\\) with \\(f(g)=gm-m\\) for all \\(g\\). This can be verified by just computing out the differential. Next, we define the \\(n\\)-Selmer groups and the Tate-Shafarevich group, which is applied to the induced exact sequence we just found in order to obtain a better bound for the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\). Finally, the finiteness of \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is obtained from the finiteness of the Selmer groups.","link":"/archives/7dbb66b9/"},{"title":"Week 2: Grothendieck topology, sites, and Riemann surfaces","text":"“Complex analysis is the good twin and real analysis the evil one: beautiful formulas and elegant theorems seem to blossom spontaneously in the complex domain, while toil and pathology rule the reals.” Charles Pugh This week I plan to start writing about what I’ve learned in PMATH 965 on algebraic stacks and PMATH 950 on Riemann surfaces. In the end of this semaster hopefully I will have written enough about them in this blog so that I can complie them into actual typesetted notes. Starting from PMATH 965, we start by introducing Grothendieck topologies and sites, and we define presheaves and sheaves on sites and show that they work almost the same as the usual presheaves and sheaves we are accostomed to. Next, I will write about étale morphisms of schemes. For PMATH 950, I will start by defining Riemann surfaces and discussing its properties. Grothendieck topology and sitesRecall that a presheaf (of sets) on a topological space \\(X\\) is a contravariant functor \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}\\), and a presheaf is a sheaf when \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow\\prod_{i}\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\rightrightarrows\\prod_{i,j}\\mathscr{F}(U_i\\cap U_j)\\) is an equalizer for every open cover \\(\\{U_{i}\\}\\) of any open \\(U\\subseteq X\\), which is equivalent to the identity and gluability axioms. We want to extend this from \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) to any category \\(\\mathcal C\\). To do this, we need to add some additional structure on the category \\(\\mathcal C\\) so that its objects can be viewed as “open sets” and morphisms can be viewed as “inclusions”. Grothendieck’s insight is that we don’t need the full strength of a topology to define sheaves, we only need intersections and a notion of when a collection of an open set forms an open cover of it. Definition 1. A Grothendieck topology on a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) is the data of a set of coverings of \\(U\\), written as \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), for each object \\(U\\in \\mathcal C\\), where each covering \\(S\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) is a set of morphisms of \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(U\\) as targets, such that for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) for each isomorphism \\(\\varphi:V\\rightarrow U\\), we have \\(\\{\\varphi\\}\\in \\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) if \\(\\{V_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) and \\(\\{W_{i,j}\\rightarrow V_i\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(V_i)\\) for each \\(i\\), then \\(\\{W_{i,j}\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) for \\(\\{V_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) and \\(W\\rightarrow U\\), all \\(W\\times_UV_i\\) exists and \\(\\{W\\times_UV_i\\rightarrow W\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(W)\\) A category \\(\\mathcal C\\) equipped with a choice of Grothendieck topology, also denoted \\(\\mathcal C\\), is a site. For example, \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) for a topological space \\(X\\) can be made into a site using the usual notion of covering. We note that in \\(\\mathrm{Op}(X)\\) we have the fibered product \\(U\\times_X V=U\\cap V\\) for all open \\(U,V\\subseteq X\\), which agrees with the usual notion of intersection. For a category \\(\\mathcal C\\) with \\(X\\in\\mathcal C\\), the category of objects over \\(X\\), denoted \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is the category where objects are morphisms \\(Y\\rightarrow X\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) and morphisms between \\(Y_1\\rightarrow X\\) and \\(Y_2\\rightarrow X\\) are all morphisms \\(Y_1\\rightarrow Y_2\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\) such that the obvious triangle commutes, i.e. \\((Y_1\\rightarrow Y_2\\rightarrow X)=Y_1\\rightarrow X\\). If \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a site, then \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) can be given a site structure, by letting \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U\\rightarrow X)\\) in \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) be \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) in \\(\\mathcal C\\). The site \\(\\mathcal C/X\\) is called the localization of the site \\(\\mathcal C\\) at \\(X\\). Suppose \\(X\\) is a scheme, then we say that the big Zariski (resp. big étale, resp. fppf) site, denoted \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{Zar}}\\) of \\(X\\) (resp. \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{ét}}\\), resp. \\((\\mathbf{Sch}/X)_{\\mathrm{fppf}}\\)), is the site where with the category whose objects are all morphism (resp. étale morphisms, resp. fppf morphisms) of schemes with target \\(X\\), where \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\) is the set families \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow X\\}\\) where \\(U=\\bigcup_i\\mathrm{Im}(U_i\\rightarrow U)\\) and each \\(U_i\\rightarrow U\\) is an open immersion (resp. étale) Definition 2. A presheaf (of sets) on a site \\(\\mathcal C\\) is a contravariant functor \\(\\mathscr{F}:\\mathcal C\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}\\), and a presheaf is a sheaf iff \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow\\prod_{i}\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\rightrightarrows\\prod_{i,j}\\mathscr{F}(U_i\\times_U U_j)\\) is an equalizer for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\). A presheaf is called separated if for all \\(U\\in\\mathcal C\\) and \\(\\{U_i\\rightarrow U\\}\\in\\mathrm{Cov}(U)\\), the map \\(\\mathscr{F}(U)\\rightarrow \\prod_i\\mathscr{F}(U_i)\\) is injective. note that a separated presheaf can be viewed as a presheaf that only satisfies one of the axioms of a sheaf, the identity axiom, but not necessaily the gluability axiom, therefore we have the obvious inclusions\\[\\{\\mathrm{sheaves}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{separated\\ presheaves}\\}\\hookrightarrow\\{\\mathrm{presheaves}\\}\\]all of which admits left adjoints, the composition of them being sheafification. Usually, we can formulate sheafification in terms of compatible germs, but since we are working over aribitrary site, it does not make sense to take a point in an object and take the product of stalks. Next, we discuss étale morphisms of schemes. Definition 3. A morphism of schemes \\(f:X\\rightarrow Y\\) is étale if one of these equivalent conditions holds \\(f\\) is smooth and locally quasi-finite, \\(f\\) is smooth and unramified, \\(f\\) is flat and unramified, \\(f\\) is locally of finite presentation and formally étale \\(f\\) is locally of finite presentation and locally a standard étale morphism, Riemann surfacesFirst, we recall what a topological surface is. A topological surface \\(X\\) is a Haussdorff topological space locally homeomorphic to an open subset of \\(\\mathbf C\\) or equivalently \\(\\mathbf R^2\\), where each homeomorphism \\(\\sigma:U\\subseteq X\\rightarrow V\\subseteq \\mathbf C\\) is called a chart. Two charts \\(\\sigma_1:U_1\\subseteq X\\rightarrow V_1\\subseteq \\mathbf C\\) and \\(\\sigma_2:U_2\\subseteq X\\rightarrow V_2\\subseteq \\mathbf C\\) are holomorphically compatible if \\(U_1\\cap U_2\\ne\\emptyset\\) implies \\(\\sigma_2\\circ\\sigma_1^{-1}:\\sigma_1[U_1\\cap U_2]\\subseteq \\mathbf C\\rightarrow \\sigma_2[U_1\\cap U_2]\\subseteq \\mathbf C\\) is holomorphic. An atlas is a collection of charts that cover the space, and is called holomorphic or complex if any two chart of it are holomorphically compatible. Two charts are analytically equivalent if for every chart in one atlast that exits a chart in the other atlas holomorphically compatible with it. A Riemann surface consists of a connected topological surface and a complex structure on it, which is an equivalence class of atlases under analytical equivalence.","link":"/archives/46fca3c5/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Number Theory","slug":"Number-Theory","link":"/tags/Number-Theory/"},{"name":"Euclidean Geometry","slug":"Euclidean-Geometry","link":"/tags/Euclidean-Geometry/"},{"name":"Algebraic Geometry","slug":"Algebraic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Algebraic-Geometry/"},{"name":"Arithmetic Geometry","slug":"Arithmetic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Arithmetic-Geometry/"},{"name":"Complex Geometry","slug":"Complex-Geometry","link":"/tags/Complex-Geometry/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Projects","slug":"Projects","link":"/categories/Projects/"},{"name":"This Week I Learned","slug":"This-Week-I-Learned","link":"/categories/This-Week-I-Learned/"},{"name":"Articles","slug":"Articles","link":"/categories/Articles/"}]}
