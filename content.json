My name is Yunhai Xiang (in Chinese: 项云海, pronounced as “yun-hi shang”), and I also go by Daniel. I’m an undergraduate pure math student at University of Waterloo in Canada. I can be reached via email. I started this math blog when I was a third year undergraduate student. Here, I usually write about the mathematics that I learned, and I sometimes share my own expository notes on math topics. Be sure to check out my personal projects!","link":"/about/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"Project Lambda: This Week I Learned","text":"This Week I Learned is my personal weekly column in mathematics. Each week, I post a new article under the category This Week I Learned on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. In each article, I write about interesting theorems I learned, exercises I did, and confusions I had over the past week. Moreover, I write about anything else that interests me: physics, computer science, philosophy, puzzles, games, anecdotes, math education, and more. Enjoy!","link":"/archives/1d22c5ec/"},{"title":"Week 1: Galois cohomology and Mordell—Weil theorem","text":"“In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.” George Cantor This week I finally finished my final project for my PMATH 499 reading course in arithmetic geometry. My project is called “Galois cohomology and weak Mordell—Weil theorem”, which is available here. Galois cohomology is the application of group cohomology to Galois groups. In particular, we know that for a perfect field \\(k\\) with an algebraic closure \\(K\\), the Galois group \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\) is isomorphic to an inverse limit of topological Galois groups \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(L/k)\\) ranging over the finite Galois extensions \\(L/k\\) with the natural projections. This fact makes \\(G\\) a profinite group, and the Krull topology, the topology of \\(G\\) endowed by the inverse limit process by viewing each finite Galois group as a topological group with the discrete topology, is a topology where a basis for the neighborhood at the identity is the collection of normal subgroups having finite index in \\(G\\). This is a motivation to use homological algebra in such situation. My final project focuses on the proof of the weak Mordell—Weil theorem, which states that for any elliptic curve \\(E\\), the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is finite for all \\(n\\ge 2\\). This is an important step in the proof of the Mordell—Weil theorem which states the elliptic curve groups are finitely generated. The proof of Mordell—Weil involves in applying an infinite descent argument to weak Mordell—Weil, which I will not go into detail. The motivating observation is that we have an exact sequence of topological \\(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)\\)-modules \\[\\mathbf{0}\\rightarrow E(K)[n]\\rightarrow E(K)\\xrightarrow{n}E(K)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{0}\\]This short exact sequence induces a long exact sequence of cohomology groups, which we truncate after the first cohomology groups. The first cohomology group can be viewed as the group of crossed homomorphisms module the principal crossed homomorphisms, where a crossed homomorphism is some \\(f\\) with \\(f(gh)=gf(h)+f(g)\\) for all \\(g,h\\) and a principal crossed homomorphism is a homomorphism where there exists \\(m\\) with \\(f(g)=gm-m\\) for all \\(g\\). This can be verified by just computing out the differential. Next, we define the \\(n\\)-Selmer groups and the Tate-Shafarevich group, which is applied to the induced exact sequence we just found in order to obtain a better bound for the group \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\). Finally, the finiteness of \\(E(k)/nE(k)\\) is obtained from the finiteness of the Selmer groups.","link":"/archives/7dbb66b9/"},{"title":"Nine Point Circle and Feuerbach's Theorem","text":"I’ve been playing with the Manim library lately. Here’s a test animation I made demonstrating the nine point circle and part of Feuerbach’s theorem. It should be noted that Feuerbach’s Theorem also tells us that the nine point circle of a triangle is tangent to the three excircles of that triangle, but I did not include that in the video.","link":"/archives/e3b6140a/"},{"title":"Project Sigma: Explorations in Mathematics","text":"Explorations in Mathematics is a collection of my personal course notes and expositions in mathematics. I decided to start this project primarily as a motivation for myself to learn and as a way of recording my learning progress. That being said, it would also make me very happy if someone else benefits from them. They will probably contain errors and typos, and if you found one, you are welcomed to open an issue page in the corresponding repository and point out my mistake. See the list below. Topic Repository Release Algebraic Geometry Project-Sigma-ALG Incomplete To download, either click the link under the Release tab for a compiled .pdf file or go to the corresponding repository and clone the repository. When writing these notes, I try to adhere to the following principles: Consistent and unambiguous notation: I use clear notation, follow the same notation conventions for everything, and clearly state any abuse of notation I use. Sketches of proof: In many cases, I provide bullet points of my reasoning for many of the exercises and theorems instead of providing full proofs. I try to make them as perspicuous and coherent as I can. Prototypical examples: I give quintessential examples and non-examples for important notions, as they help myself to build intuitions for abstract concepts. I hope you enjoy reading them as I enjoyed writing them!","link":"/archives/2b4d8af0/"},{"title":"Forgetful Functor, Fall 2021","text":"Forgetful Functor is an online learning seminar in algebraic geometry held by undergraduate students at University of Waterloo in Fall 2021.

The main text we follow is Foundations of Algebraic Geometry by Ravi Vakil. We read 0.5 to 1 chapters per week, and have a 30 minute to 1 hour discussion each Sunday on 7 PM EDT, in which a main speaker gives a short overview of the reading material of the past week and we discuss problems together. Some other texts we use are Algebraic Geometry by Robin Hartshorne and Categories and Homological Algebra by Pierre Schapira. Here are the details for each week’s meeting.
