Project Sigma: The EgregiumIn a nutshell, Project Sigma is a collection of my personal course notes on various math subjects, titled The Egregium. All course notes in this collection will have their own GitHub repository. Read more: Project Sigma. Project Lambda: This Week I LearnedProject Lambda is my personal project of a weekly column titled This Week I Learned, where I write about the interesting theorems, examples, and exercises that I came across in the past week, and more. All articles of this column are in the category This Week I Learned.

I’m an undergraduate pure math student at the University of Waterloo, Canada. I can be reached via email y38xiang@uwaterloo.ca, and my GitHub profile is yunhaixiang. The Singularity is my personal blog where I post math related content at least biweekly. I am interested in algebraic geometry, and hence the majority of my posts will be related to it. I will also post about my Personal Projects which range from collections of my course notes to my weekly column posts. Moreover, I occasionally post about my life, the books I read, video games I played, and more.","link":"/about/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"Project Lambda: This Week I Learned","text":"Project Lambda is my personal project of a weekly column titled This Week I Learned, where I post a new article under the category This Week I Learned each week on Friday or Saturday. In each of those articles, I will write about the following things An overview of the past week. I will briefly go over the things I studied in the past week: which chapters of which books I read and which exercises I did. In particular, I will highlight any interesting or important theorems, facts, examples or exercises I came over, as well as my questions and confusions. Objectives of next week. If I have the time, I will set a rough outline of my study plan of next week. I will not, however, always follow this outline. I like to be very flexible with my schedules. Anythings else that’s interesting. I will write about anything else that interests me, which can be high school or university level math competition problems, or even something completely unrelated to math.

Here’s a test animation I made demonstrating the nine point circle and part of Feuerbach’s theorem. It should be noted that Feuerbach’s Theorem also tells us that the nine point circle of a triangle is tangent to the three excircles of that triangle, but I did not include that in the video.","link":"/archives/e3b6140a/"},{"title":"Project Sigma: The Egregium","text":"Project Sigma is a collection of my personal course notes on various mathematical topics, titled The Egregium. I decided to start this project primarily as a motivation for myself to learn and as a way of recording my learning progress. That being said, it would also make me very happy if someone else benefits from my work. Each of the subject will have their own GitHub repository, typically named as “Project-Sigma-XXX” where XXX is an abbriviation of the subject. They will probably contain errors, and if you found one, you are welcomed to open an issue page on the respective repository and point out my mistake. Currently, the following subjects are planned. Subject Repository Release Algebraic Geometry Project-Sigma-ALG Incomplete I also plan to add new subjects in the future, but only after the current ones are almost completed. To download, either click the link under the Release tab or go to the corresponding repository and clone the repository directly. When writing these notes, I will try to adhere to the following philosophies: Consistent and unambiguous notation: this means that I will follow the same notation conventions for all of the course notes and exercises. I will also clearly state any abuse of notation I will use. Sketches of proof: this means that I will provide bullet points of my reasoning for many of the exercises and theorems instead of providing full proofs. I will try to make them as perspicuous and coherent as I can. Prototypical examples: this means that I will give quintessential examples and non-examples for important notions. Examples help myself to build intuitions for abstract concepts.

I hope you enjoy reading these notes as I enjoyed writing them!","link":"/archives/2b4d8af0/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Number Theory","slug":"Number-Theory","link":"/tags/Number-Theory/"},{"name":"Euclidean Geometry","slug":"Euclidean-Geometry","link":"/tags/Euclidean-Geometry/"},{"name":"Algebraic Geometry","slug":"Algebraic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Algebraic-Geometry/"},{"name":"Arithmetic Geometry","slug":"Arithmetic-Geometry","link":"/tags/Arithmetic-Geometry/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Projects","slug":"Projects","link":"/categories/Projects/"},{"name":"This Week I Learned","slug":"This-Week-I-Learned","link":"/categories/This-Week-I-Learned/"},{"name":"Articles","slug":"Articles","link":"/categories/Articles/"}]}
