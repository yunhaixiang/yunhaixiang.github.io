<p>I was very hesitant about writing this article, for the fear that my ignorance of logic theory and philosophy might prompt me to say something profoundly stupid and embarrass myself (which I probably will anyway). Nevertheless, I couldn’t resist the temptation. These ideas have circulated in my mind for too long, and I couldn’t help but share it with others. Therefore, I ask the reader to indulge me in spilling some nonsense, which, in my defense, even if worthless mathematically, may still serve as a fun sci-fi project or thought experiment. The question I’m interested in is the following. Imagine an alien civilization on a distant planet in a solar system millions of lightyears away which is advanced enough to have developed their own “mathematics” (whatever it means). <em>What would their mathematics be like?</em> To break this down into several smaller questions: firstly, what would their formal logical system (to make things interesting, we assume they do use one) be like; secondly, what would the mathematical objects they study be like; and thirdly, what would their theorems be like? </p>

        <p>Recently, I gave another talk on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://puremath.club/events/w23#14">Short Attention Span Math Seminars</a> which is a friendly introduction to category theory. Here are my <a href="/documents/category.pdf">slides</a>, and here are the <a href="/documents/abstractions.pdf">slides</a> for the first five minutes. In my talk, I first talked about the idea of abstractions, then I talked about the categorical way of thing and along the way talked about many ideas like universal properties, functors, natural transformations. In the end, this culminated in the Yoneda lemma or the fundamental theorem of category theory. I also discussed a little an application of it to algebraic geometry, the functor of points, and how this could be used to construct (fine) moduli spaces such as Grassmannians.</p>

<p>Continuing last week, we are finally going to define the derived category \(D(\mathcal A)\) for an abelian category \(\mathcal A\). Before we actually do that, we need to introduce localization of categories, and we will define the derived category in terms of a localization of the homotopy category of complexes. Localization of categories is very analogous to localization of rings or modules. Given any category (with no assumption of abelian, additive, triangulated, etc), we formally invert a class of morphisms. We will give one definition in terms of a localization construction and show that it is unsatisfactory in that it does not have a lot of useful and desirable properties. We will then develop a better description of derived categories in terms of roofs.</p>

<p>Continuing last week where we defined the homotopy category of complexes, we will take a look at triangulated categories. This will help us build towards the definition of derived categories. In some sense, triangulated categories are approximations of abelian categories. They are not strictly speaking a weaker version of abelian categories, and they don’t really imply each other. Triangulated categories takes a different approach to abelian categories. Instead of kernels, cokernels, and strict morphisms, triangulated categories bypass these notions and start out with “distinguished triangles”, which are similar to exact sequences.</p>

<p>I have always been curious about derived categories. In particular, I read from the wikipedia page on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry">homological mirror symmetry</a> that the derived category of coherent sheaves is a popular research topic in algebraic geometry. Also, I’ve been told by a professor that derived categories are related to something called geometric Satake correspondance, which is also something I totally don’t understand but it sounds very cool. Therefore, I decided to study a little about derived categories, and write about my progress here. I want this post to be the first part in several parts of my notes. In this first part, we will focus on abelian categoires, derived functors, and homotopy category of complexes. We begin by reviewing abelian categories and their properties. In particular, the (co)chain complexes in an abelian category and their related notions. After that, we define derived functors. Eventually, we finish by defining the homotopy category of complexes \(K(\mathcal A)\).</p>

<p>I spent my last week in Quebec attending the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cumc.math.ca/2022/presentation-database">Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2022</a>. It was really an intense week of learning. I learned a lot and met many smart and interesting people. So I wanted to write about the things I learned and the people I met during the conference. There were so many excellent talks but unfortunately I could only attend some of them. In particular, there are some very good ones in geometry, topology, representation theory, algebra, logic theory, etc. </p>

        <p>Last week I gave a talk on the Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2022 on Schubert calculus and cohomology of Grassmannians. The Grassmannian is a space that parameterises linear subspaces, and the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian, the Chow ring, encodes data useful for intersection theory. In my talk, I introduced the definition of a Grassmannian as a manifold (via the Stiefel manifold or as a homogeneous space) and as a projective variety (via the Plücker embedding). Then I introduced the decomposition of Grassmannian into Schubert cells and Schubert varieties (by CW-decomposition and affine stratification). After that, I introduced the Chow ring. Here are the <a href="/documents/grassmannian.pdf">slides</a> of my talk.</p>

        <p>It is a well known fact that there is no general formula for quintic equations or algebraic equations of any higher degree, and a typical proof of this fact uses heavy machinery from Galois theory. However, there is a far more elementary but much less well known proof by V.I. Arnold using nothing more than basic knowledge of complex numbers and topology. Last week, I gave a talk on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://puremath.club/events/s22#7">Short Attention Span Math Seminars</a> organized by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://puremath.club/">Pure Math Club</a> at University of Waterloo. In my talk, I explained the main idea of his proof: moving the coefficients along loops to induce permutations of the roots. I also talked about how it could be turned into a rigorous proof using Riemann surfaces of algebraic functions and their monodromy groups, as well as its connections to Galois theory. In the end, I also discussed briefly some ideas related to this proof, such as topological Galois theory and Grothendieck’s Galois theory. Here are my <a href="/documents/insolvability.pdf">slides</a>.</p>

<p>For this week, I’ll write about the theory of root systems, especially things related to Weyl groups, weight spaces and etc, for the purpose of my URA. This is because one of the objectives of my URA is to generalise my <a href="/archives/66165fd0/">previous blog post</a> about a fraction of an \(S_n\)-orbit on a hyperplane to Weyl groups. First, a Lie algebra is <em>simple</em> if it is of degree greater than \(1\) (so we are excluding the one dimensional abelian Lie algebras) and has no proper ideals, and a semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. Equivalently, a Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) is semisimple if \(\mathrm{rad}(\mathfrak{g})\), the sum of all solvable ideals (or the maximal solvable ideal), is trivial. Any semisimple Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group \(G\). Let \(\mathrm{ad}:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g})\) by \((\mathrm{ad} X)(Z)=[X,Z]\) be the <em>adjoint representation</em>. Let \(B:\mathfrak{g}\times \mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathbf C\) be the symmetric bilinear form defined by \(B(X,Y)=\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{ad}X\mathrm{ad} Y)\), called the <em>Killing form</em> which is invariant in the sense of \(B([X,Y],Z)=B(X,[Y,Z])\). Cartan’s criterion for semisimplicity says that a Lie algebra is semisimple iff the associated Killing form is nondegenerate. From now on, we let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be a semisimple Lie algebra over \(\mathbf C\). We start by discussing the root–space decomposition \(\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}\oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Phi}\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}\) of semisimple Lie algebras.</p>

<p>This week is the first week of the spring term and also my first week of undergraduate research with Prof. Satriano, so I decided to write about a research paper I’ve given to read, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08535.pdf">this one</a>. In a nutshell, the paper proves a combinatorical conjecture posed by McKinnon, Satriano and Huang, about orbits on a hyperplane under permutation. Specifically, suppose that \(\sigma\in S_n\) acts on \(v\in\mathbf R^n\) by permutation, and let \(\mathcal{O}(v, w)=\{\sigma\in S_n: w\cdot \sigma v=0\}\). We prove a best bound for the number of vectors obtained by permutation of coordinates that are contained in a hyperplane through the origin except for \(\sum_ix_i=0\), where \(n\ge 3\). In notations, we have the following theorem.</p>
