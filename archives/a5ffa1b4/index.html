<p>I was very hesitant about writing this article, for the fear that my ignorance of logic theory and philosophy might cause me to say something profoundly stupid and embarrass myself (which I probably will anyway). Nevertheless, I couldn’t resist the temptation. These ideas have circulated in my mind for too long, and I couldn’t help but share it with others. Therefore, I ask the reader to indulge me in spilling some nonsense, which, in my defense, even if worthless mathematically, may still serve as a fun sci-fi project or thought experiment. The question I’m interested in is the following. Imagine an alien civilization on a distant planet in a solar system millions of lightyears away which is advanced enough to have developed their own “mathematics” (whatever it means). <em>What would their mathematics be like?</em> To break this down into several smaller questions: firstly, what would their formal logical system (to make things interesting, we assume they do use one) be like; secondly, what would the mathematical objects they study be like; and thirdly, what would their theorems be like? </p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Before we start discussing these questions, allow me to explain why I believe these questions are worth thinking about. In human history, different cultures all developed the notion of natural numbers, albeit obviously having different representations of them. For the Arabs, it’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on, for the Romans, it’s I, II, III, IV, V, VI, and so on. While the Arabic numerals use the position of a symbol to denote its value (place-value system), the Roman numerals have fixed values for each symbol (I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, and so on). They are both fully faithful representations of natural numbers, but some theorems are easier to discover and prove if you are working in the “right” representation. For example, I’d imagine that it would be easier for the Arabs (or any other culture that use place-valued based 10 representation of natural numbers) to discover and prove the theorem that a natural number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, since this theorem is due to the fact that 10 equivalent to 1 modulo 3, which is easier to observe in arabic numbers. Of course, the theorem is still true for roman numbers, as we can easily translate between the two representations. Another example from elementary mathematics is different coordinate systems of the plane, such as Cartesian coordinates vs. polar coordinate. There are many examples from elementary calculus on the plane, which are easier to calculate when you swap to a different coordinate system. Similarly, I think working in the “right” foundations makes some theorems easier to discover and prove. This is already evident in human mathematics. The development of a new foundation of mathematics, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory">homotopy type theory</a> (I don’t claim any familiarity with this area, so I could be wrong), has alrady had some impacts on homotopy theory, as it handles \(\infty\)-groupoids, an abstract homotopical model for topological spaces, more naturally compared to traditional set-theoretic foundations à la Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. </p>
<p>Therefore, you can tell that I actually lied a little in my motivating question: it’s not that I care about aliens. I only phrased the question in terms of aliens as an excuse to provoke thoughts on a body of hypothetical mathematics, along with a foundation thereof, independent of human intuition, experience, and practical needs. You can think of “aliens” as a metaphor for an abstract agent, not necessarily literal aliens living in our universe, capable of advanced reasoning but possibly in a drastically different fasion. Perhaps the foundations we use today, such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, are too successful, which has maybe made us lazy to think about other possibilities. Granted, we have played with many other set theories and type theories, but those are more or less motivated by the mathematics of our species. I firmly believe that there’s a lot more room for exploration, and that if we wish to, we could be much more imaginative in our foundations. Perhaps, unbeknownst to us, there is a foundation of mathematics out there radically different from all foundations we have which could shed light on areas of math in ways we couldn’t fathom yet. In an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf">AMS Notice</a> about Alexander Grothendieck, Michel Demazure said “I did not view him as I did other great mathematicians, who were made of the same fabric — better fabric, to be sure, as they were brighter, faster, harder workers. Grothendieck always seemed essentially different; he was an <em>‘alien.’</em>“ Grothendieck’s way of thinking is so “alien” and yet, once adopted, is so natural, that as Katz described, “it’s hard to imagine the time before you thought that way.” Thus, I invite you to entertain the idea of thinking as an alien.</p>
<h4 id="Extraterrestrial-Ethnomathematics"><a href="#Extraterrestrial-Ethnomathematics" class="headerlink" title="Extraterrestrial Ethnomathematics"></a>Extraterrestrial Ethnomathematics</h4><p>I would like to begin with some naïve thoughts, both to reinforce the points I made in the previous paragraphs, and to pave the way for the next section. A fundamental observation is: human experience, intuition, and societal influences, has played a major role in the development of human mathematics, and consequently in human foundations of mathematics. Naturally, one wonders what if these variables are different for the aliens?</p>
<p>Firstly, what if the aliens experience the world differently? I’d imagine if the alien’s body is made of gas, plasma, or some spooky quantum state matter, they would probably have a much more esoteric perception of the notion of distance. Perhaps even non-archimedean distance is more natural to them? Maybe they discover \(p\)-adic numbers before they discover real numbers? In human history, real numbers and the rigorization of calculus (real analysis) is central to the development of foundations. Perhaps \(p\)-adic numbers would play a similar role in the alien’s development of mathematical foundations, leading to different definitions of these structures? On the other hand, what if the aliens live in a universe where the laws of physics is different? This may affect their concept of many fundamental notions, such as space or shape. Their perceptions of causality may also affect their concept of probability, and so on.</p>
<p>Secondly, what if the alien’s intuition, that is, the way their brain works, is different? In Liu Cixin’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34569357-remembrance-of-earth-s-past"><em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em></a> scifi trilogy (spoilors!), he described an alien civilization, the trisolarans, who spontaneously and instantaneously communicate their cognition through electromagnetic waves. To the trisolarans, thinking is the same as speaking, and therefore they have no concept of deception, which gave them a big disadvantage against humans when they invaded earth. Similar things might be true for math. When I was learning algebraic topology for the first time, I found the calculations of fundamental groups and homology groups using Seifert–van Kampen theorem and Mayer–Vietoris sequences particularly interesting. Compared to other proofs we do, they seem to depend highly on pictorial intuition. This kind of intuition is especially common in the study of low-dimensional topology (the studies of knots, braids, and 3- or 4-manifolds), where mathematicians often work with pictorial intuition before writing down rigorous proofs. A general rule seems to be that the more intuition we have of something, the less reliant we are on its formalisms. One could imagine that there might be aliens who are able to perform this kind of informal intuitive argument on higher dimensional or non-archimedean spaces, which we mere humans can only approach with rigorous formalism.</p>
<p>Thirdly, what if the aliens have different societal influences on mathematics? For example, in human history, the development of various number systems, from \(\mathbb N\), to \(\mathbb Z\), to \(\mathbb Q\), and to \(\mathbb R\), is rooted in our demands for increasingly sophisticated mathematical structures in socioeconomic production such as accounting and engineering. From counting discrete finite things with natural numbers, to including negative and rational numbers for the purpose of representing money, and to including numbers arising in geometry such as \(\pi\) and square roots (arising as length of hypotenuse of right triangles), and so on. An alien society with possibly different socioeconomic demands may lead to a different line of development of number systems, or perhaps they didn’t start with \(\mathbb N\) to begin with! The study of number systems begat the study of abstract rings, hence one could imagine aliens having different axioms for rings. And this could be said about many other mathematical structures and their abstractions.</p>
<p>The more one ponders about these possibilities, the more one realizes that human mathematics is by no means natural or unique epistemologically – there are a lot of things in our math that are rather arbitrary. Aliens could disagree with us on what mathematical objects are more basic, which elaborations of the basic objects are more natural, which body of mathematics is more intuitive, which mathematical structures better capture fundamental notions, and so on. In a nutshell, our mathematics is not universal!</p>
<h4 id="The-Universal-Idea"><a href="#The-Universal-Idea" class="headerlink" title="The Universal Idea"></a>The Universal Idea</h4><p>In the previous section, we talked about what could be different for alien math, but a much more fundamental and much more challenging question is, what would be universal among all alien’s (and our) math? Here, I propose a candidate answer to this question: the idea of abstraction. We start by looking at the abstractions in human math.</p>
<p>One subtle thing about natural numbers that perhaps many people don’t realize, probably due to the fact that we are so used to them, is that they are already an abstraction. They are an abstraction of the notion of finite size (as cardinals) or finite well order (as ordinals). Here lets just focus on the former. From an early age we learn to count things with our fingers, but what we are really doing is establishing a bijection between our fingers and the things we are counting. We do this because we realize that counting is the same mechanism regardless of the thing we are counting. Counting our fingers and counting anything else are isomorphic! The natural numbers is the abstraction of this mechanism. It is meaningless to ask if the number \(1\) really exists, just like it is meaningless to ask if \(\sqrt{-1}\) or \(\pi\) or quaternions really exist: they are nothing more than abstractions. Similarly, a set of points equidistant to a fixed point is our abstraction of circles, \(\mathbb Z/12\) is the abstraction of the hour hand on a clock, and so on. This is what I like to call abstraction level 0. Mathematicians realize that a lot of these structures share a lot of things in common. Therefore, we organize them into “types” of objects. Symmetries are studied as “groups”, shapes as “topological spaces”, number systems as “rings”, and so on. This is what I like to call abstraction level 1. Of course, one could go further, abstraction level 2 would be categories, and so on. This idea of abstraction is so natural and fundamental to mathematics that, in some sense, one could argue that abstraction is precisely what characterizes mathematics ontologically. I do not believe that there are aliens who do math by simply generating theorems from axioms using inference rules (and if so, it is debatable what they are doing is actually math). There must be a point where they introduce concepts and definitions of mathematical objects. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the dichotomy of analytic v.s. synthetic mathematics, which arises naturally from abstractions. To oversimplify, analytic methods “break down” things and synthetic methods “put together” things. For example, in elementary Euclidean geometry, the analytic approach to solving problems would be to introduce coordinates and characterize geometric shapes as solutions of polynomial equations. This approach cares more about what the objects of study are “made of”. In this case, they are made of points in Euclidean space satisfying polynomial equations. In contrast, a synthetic approachs would start from something akin to Euclid’s axioms in the <em>Elements</em> or their modern counterparts such as Tarski’s axioms or Hilbert’s axioms. Synthetic approaches don’t care much about what the objects of study are made of, instead they care more about what we can infer from properties already expected. Often times, this synthetic v.s. analytic dichotomy go by the disguise of “definition v.s. example”, “syntax v.s. semantics”, or “axioms v.s. models”. This is something that must arise from abstractions since if we have abstractions then we must also have the dual process of abstraction: specification, the process of endowing concrete models to the abstract descriptions of objects. Formally, this duality can be formulated as a Galois connection (a generalization of the Galois correspondance in the fundamental theorem of Galois theory).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theorem 1. (Lawvere) Let \(L\) be a language, \(A\) the set of \(L\)-sentences, and \(S\) the set of \(L\)-structures. Define \(\mathcal A\) the poset \(\mathcal P(A)\) w.r.t. inclusion and \(\mathcal S\) the poset \(\mathcal P(S)\) w.r.t. inclusion. Define morphisms</p>
<ol>
<li>\(f_{*}:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal S\), where \(f_{*}(\alpha)=\{s \mid \forall \varphi\in\alpha, s \vDash \varphi\}\)</li>
<li>\(f^{*}:\mathcal S\rightarrow \mathcal A\), where \(f^{*}(\sigma)=\{\varphi \mid \forall s\in \sigma, s \vDash \varphi\}\)</li>
</ol>
<p>then \(f_{*}\vdash f^{*}\) is a Galois connection, i.e. we have<br>\[f_{*}(\alpha)\subseteq \sigma\Longleftrightarrow\alpha\subseteq f^{*}(\sigma)\] for all \(\alpha\in \mathcal A\) and \(\sigma\in \mathcal S\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first saw this theorem, it immediately reminded me of Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz. Not only are they both Galois connections, but also both “generated” by relations that could be described as “\(a\) satisfies \(b\)” (perhaps it could be named the “logical Nullstellensatz”). I think this shows that the syntax v.s. semantics adjunction is more than just philosophical, it is also mathematically canon. Therefore, If we assume that abstractions are universal among all alien mathematics, then so must be the case for specification and the synthetic v.s. analytic dichotomy.</p>
<h4 id="A-Natural-Foundation"><a href="#A-Natural-Foundation" class="headerlink" title="A Natural Foundation?"></a>A Natural Foundation?</h4><p>In my first undergraduate class, I learned about Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory – the foundations of (the majority of) modern mathematics. However, I never felt truely convinced by Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. Don’t get me wrong, I have no doubt of its rigor or success as a foundation of mathematics. What I mean is that I get a sense that many things about it are incredibly “awkward” or “unnatural”, for lack of a better word. I’ll only discuss one example: the definition of cardinal numbers. Naïvely, one would define a cardinal number as the following</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Naïve) Definition. <em>A cardinal number is an equivalence class of sets under bijection.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is ludicrous, we can’t have the natural number 1 be a proper class. The actual definition of cardinal numbers is much more sophisticated: it is an ordinal number not equinumerous as any smaller ordinals, and ordinals are in turn defined as a set strictly well ordered by membership and every subset of which is an element. This definition, due to von Neumann, circumvents the set-theoretic issue by “restricting” the class of sets to its “skeleton”, ordinal numbers, in order to prevent cardinal numbers themselves from being too large. However, I argue that this naïve definition is what captures the idea of cardinals more naturally, because it emphasizes the conceptual meaning of cardinal numbers that they are avatars of the cardinalities of sets. This is not seen in von Neumann’s definition, in which the well-order structure comes first and is substantial to the definition. I was quite surprised to learn that in some type theories, the naïve definition actually works. This means that the crux of this problem really is of a set-theoretic nature. </p>
<p>In all human math foundations, one common theme  seems to be to build mathematical objects from certain “atomic” or “basic” objects (and relations). In set theory, there is only one basic object, namely sets; and only one basic relation, namely membership. Thus, set theory could be considered as a synthetic theory for sets. Everything else is built from sets, even if the mathematical object isn’t usally understood as a collection, such as a tuple \((x,y)=\{x,\{x,y\}\}\), a natural number \(2=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\), or a function \(f\subseteq X\times Y\). My guess is, the fact that the naïve definition could work in type theories may be explained by the fact that the basic objects in type theory, namely types, are more intricate. I presume the justification for this philosophy is that it is an easy way to make sure everything is consistent with everything else (at least we hope so since we can’t prove this due to Gödel). And also because, well, we have to start somewhere, don’t we? I concur with this point, but still I’m not fully convinced by this philosophy, and I bet that there are alien civilizations who agree with me on this. The problem I have with it is, none of these “atomic objects” seem “canonical”. The notions of function, relation, and many others seem equally fundamental as the notion of sets, and one could imagine some aliens using “function theory” or “relation theory” as their foundation. It is difficult to assert that any of the notions of “function”, “relation”, “sets”, etc, are more basic than all others. I guess you could also take the utilitarian point of view: it doesn’t matter what the basic object is, as long as it works. But I’m not satisfied by this. </p>
<p>This prompted the question: what is the canonical basic notion? First, what makes a notion “basic”? Let’s take a step back and first think about why do people usually consider the notion of collection, i.e. sets, a basic notion? From the Bourbaki point of view, a “mathematical structure” is a set with possible extra structures, such as algebaric structures, topological structures, or order structures, and various combinations of them. A morphism between these structures would be a function of sets preserving said structures, and then we could talk about these objects up to isomorphisms. In this sense, sets are basic because all “mathematical structures” by definition are built from them. However, this point of view is restrictive. Categorically, we have meaningful categories that are not concrete, i.e., doesn’t have a (fully faithful) forgetful functor to \(\mathbf{Set}\). I also don’t believe that the ubiquity of a notion would imply primitivity, eventhough assuming so would be good for practical reasons. From a maybe naïve point of view, a way to approximate primitivity is to see if it could encode all of hitherto human math. In this sense, a lot of other notions, not just sets, could be considered basic. Second, even if we agree on which objects are the more basic, which one is the canonical one? We usually say something is canonical if we deem it to be “archetypical”. This again is a very difficult question. On the syntactical side, take for example the ZFC axioms – some of them are not really about sets “as a collection”, such as axioms of infinity and choice. An alien who probably doesn’t know how humans encode functions and natural numbers as sets would be understandably confused why these two axioms would appear in a axiomatic theory for the notion of “collection”. This is in stark contracts with the axioms of extensionality, power set, and pairing. Thus, in some sense, ZFC is not canonical either. What then would the canonical basic notion be? Let me take a radical stance at this question: <em>there is no canonical basic notion (or foundation) at all!</em> </p>
<p>Before I attempt to justify this claim, I would like to make a digression from the world of math to the world of the philosophy of science. There is an idea in science relevant to our discussion: reductionism. Reductionism is the belief that things can be explained by breaking it down into smaller more fundamental things. According to this philosophy, physics is just applied math, chemistry is just applied physics, and so on.</p>

<p>Reductionism has been criticized by many, but most famously by P.W. Anderson in his <em>More is Different</em>. In a nutshell, Anderson argues that “the main fallacy of this idea is that the reductionist hypothesis does not by any means imply a constructionist one: the ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe.” This is not entirely irrelevant to our discussion. The fact that we can reduce most mathematical structures to more basic constructions, doesn’t imply that we should start from the most basic notion and build everything on top. The fact that we can’t find a canonical basic notion may be an indication of this. </p>
<p>But if we don’t do this, how do we ensure a synthetic theory works well with another synthetic theory? After all, many mathematial theories are intertwined and interconnected. Ay, there’s the rub! I believe what we could possibly attempt is to create an intricate metaframework machinery across all possible (synthetic) theories, with details on how they work together in a natural way. This way, all mathematical theories and objects are synthetic simultaneously – all in their “natural habitat”! This would be in contrast with set theory, where we work inside the synthetic theory of sets and add axioms to allow for construction of all other things using sets. Initially, I was inclined to call this idea a possibility for “universal foundation”, but I realized that this is not the most accurate word. What I’m postulating is not exactly “universal” in the sense of universal properties. I’m not asking for a foundation that subsumes all others, or one through which all others factor. Instead, it is metaframework. As an analogy, I would say this is more like gluing up local coordinate charts to form a manifold, or gluing up affine schemes with a sheaf to form a scheme. In contrast with traditional ways, where the edifice of math stands upon a solid agreed-upon base, this would be more base-free (or coordinate-free). I am aware that this task seems highly unrealistic to the point of despair, but again, this is just brainstorming. Brainstorming never hurts! </p>
<p>If such an idea is not entirely my own idiotic fantasy, would it be considered a “natural foundation”? Well, that I’m not qualified to judge. But I think that even if it existed, it wouldn’t supersede traditional set-theoretic foundations, at least pedagogically. The way first order logic works is very similar to our natural languages (perhaps it is why we use them in the first place), and traditional foundations have been so sucessful, it might not mean much to make this change anyway. Nevertheless, I’d like to think more about it when I have better mathematical maturity. I think this is a good point for me to stop rambling my nonsense. </p>
